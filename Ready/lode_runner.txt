1. INTRODUCTION

    1-1. BASIC LODE RUNNER

Lode Runner's a simple old game. You are equipped with a gun that can dig 
holes in soft ground, which allow you to fall through them or trap enemies 
who chase you albeit at a slower pace. If the hole closes over the enemy, he 
regenerates at the top. Your object is to pick up all the gold in a level 
full of ladders and ropes and hard ground and even false ground and climb to 
the top of the level(a flashing ladder in the Arcade case.) If the bad guys 
catch you or you fall into your own trap and get swallowed up, you lose. The 
game is grid based so there are only exact spots where you can dig. It was 
originally created by Doug Smith and has gone through several incarnations on 
different platforms.

Some feature very similar levels across platforms; for instance the NES 
version takes 50 levels, most of which map to an Apple II level(where the 
game was originally ported) minus a few rows. The SNES and Turbografx appear 
to pretty up some old levels without offering new challenges. All ports that 
maintain the grid structure and basic icons have slightly different AIs and 
some have completely different levels or neat new power-ups(the PSX version--
LR and LR extra--has bombs which permanently destroy part of a level, or a 
stun gun), some are wickedly tough(GBA Lode Runner, Apple Championship Lode 
Runner--not a port, but just a shifting of levels) and some go off in 
different directions entirely(Lode Runner 2(PC) is 3-d isometric and looks 
like Q*Bert; Nintendo 64's has you walking almost on wire structures and has 
some vicious plants that attack you. But it works.)

The arcade versions have some old levels and some new ones, but given that 
the monsters are faster and smarter there's enough fresh air that many that 
were trivial in old versions of Lode Runner are challenging--especially when 
you get point bonuses for efficient form.

    1-2. DIFFERENCES FOR THE ARCADE GAME VS EARLY PC

Of course the arcade version doesn't allow you to create levels, sadly. It's 
there to eat your money. So it has a selection of pretty tough levels. Lode 
Runner I has 24 of them; II-IV have 30. Each group of 3 levels has a 
different set of monsters but the only difference is visual. They don't work 
together, and they all have the same AI, so they do tend to clump together 
for your advantage.

First thing you'll notice is that your enemies are much faster than in the PC 
version. Also, aren't stupid. They try to get horizontally level with you and 
run at you. If you climb up the bottom of the ladder, they won't run away. 
Hey, it was an arcade game, they needed as many quick deaths as they could 
get.

The icons are arranged a bit differently. The board is 24x32, with people and 
gold being 1x2 icons. The result is that some platforms that look like they 
are level with each other, aren't. This means that sometimes when you dig you 
will have a pit half your size. You can't jump out of it. You have to avoid 
it.

This gets sticky but on the other hand you can grab gold while on a rope if 
the gold is right below the rope--and you can dig under a rope, although 
enemies won't fall into the holes you dig. It's more for escape.

~
$
$ <i gold piece actually. You can grab it.

XXX*
XXX*XXXX <i dig looks like this.
XXXXXXXX  You fall in.

You also get bonuses at level's end for winning quickly and/or without 
trapping or killing enemies. And sometimes you get a break with regard to 
enemies not being killed. You and enemies both walk over healing holes, while 
in most other installations it is death to do so. This is more immediately 
risky for you if you've laid out a few holes in a row hoping to trap enemies 
but makes the no-kill bonuses easier to achieve for a skilled player.

  2. CONTROLS

If you are playing from MAME the controls may be a bit tricky, with the left 
CTRL and left ALT being used to dig. I set P1 button 1 to Z and P1 button 2 
to X, so you can use those to dig left and right respectively.

If you try to move diagonally, up/down override left/right. So if you want to 
get on that ladder, it works, but to get off it you have to push left/right 
explicitly.

If you want to dig or fall, note that your movement is quantized. A Lode 
Runner board is 24x32 with your icon being 1x2 and there's no way to, say, 
fall in the middle of a column. You'll automatically shimmy to the nearest 
one and fall. Also note it takes time to dig, so if an enemy is too nearby, 
he'll walk over what you dug and get to you.

You should also note that it takes time to get off a ladder. So if an enemy 
is in too-hot pursuit you may be out of luck, and you need to take that into 
account when approaching an enemy. In fact it can be tough to get off a 
ladder sometimes RIGHT when you want so you may want to fall from above.

You'll also notice that you can jump up a bit for the rope. Icons are now 
every half-human-height, so the rope may not be right where you can grab it.

yes yes no

The whole thing about icons not being the same size as you or your enemies is 
very important also when dealing with where to dig holes or walk. For 
instance, if you have this:

HXX
HXXXX
HXXXX

Digging right from the ladder won't let you go right. It will create;

H
H  XX
HXXXX

  3. SCORING AND LEVEL DIVISIONS

You lose a man if you run out of time, touch an enemy, get killed in a hole 
you dug, or wind up in a space you can't get out of. The game can detect when 
you are trapped, sometimes, too. "YOU ARE BOUND TO DIE" and you restart from 
there.

You get 200 for each chest, 100 for each guy you entrap, and 100 for each guy 
you kill.

Extra men at 50000.

You get bonuses for various tricks.
--walking over a group of 3 guys in a row you entrapped=3000
--landing on a guy after falling=1000
--sealing off your enemies where they can't get to you=10000

If you complete a level with more than half the original time remaining, you 
get double the bonus time amount. When you have 1/4 of your time remaining, a 
tune plays every 100 points to remind you. You lose about 50 bonus points per 
second.
Without entrapment(i.e. digging to trap a guy): 20000
Killed no enemies(no one gets stuck in a hole): 10000

This allows for interesting sub-puzzles for handling levels efficiently. Of 
course it's not always possible to get whichever bonus, but you can try.

Each block of 3 levels gets you a new group of enemies. They think the same 
and are just as fast, but they look different. They're all about equally 
weird and lethal.

Levels 1-3 have blue haired men in green loincloths.
Levels 4-6 have pompomlegged jellyfish resembling a cat toy my cats ignore.
Levels 7-9 have frogeyed hunchbacks in a red shirt and blue pants.
Levels 10-12 have robots with terminals for heads and pincers for hands.
Levels 13-15 have orange and white party crackers that tumble end-to-end. 
These guys are a bit tricky as they can climb up a ladder they're just below.
Levels 16-18 have bat-eared flightless armless dragons.
Levels 19-21 have multicolored jellyfish.
Levels 22-24 have arch shaped multipastel crabs? Or maybe skeletal hip bones?

There's nothing terribly complex about this level, and after a few times your 
greatest worry will probably be how long it takes for the final guy to dump 
his gold, if you just go up the right side and want to get the whole bonus.

But there's an easy way to get the 20000 no-entrap bonus and the double-time 
bonus too. Get the gold to the right. Then head to the left and stay under 
the ladder. Wait until the third enemy drops from the rope above, then go up 
and right for a gold, back left and up, left for the gold at the top, then 
right and up and walk all the way left. Get the gold in the UL and then run 
back right. The end of level ladder will appear, and you need to shake the 
two guys on it. Fall right and down. Just run to the ladder on the right and 
they'll follow you. Up-left-up. You win.

The timing for the no-kill bonus is tricky here so you may want to skip that. 
However, if you are game, then you can work as follows: go right to the 
ladder, wait for the guy to almost get to you, then go U-L-U-L to the block 
at the edge. Wait for the guy to almost get to you again and fall left. Dig 
the leftmost block and wait for the enemy to fall in. Go UL to get the stuff 
in the corner and immediately dig right, fall and go left and down. You 
should be able to loop back to the right, where you can work your way up to 
the top unmolested. Drop into the V and once you get the final gold, a ladder 
will appear in the middle of the V. Climb it to advance.

If things get a bit jumbled, though, you can remember to try to get your 
enemies lined up. Standing on the middle platform on the right(just right of 
the chest in the V) will make your enemies go to the UL. So you can just 
clear out the bottom, do that and walk to the top. The main annoyance here is 
that regenerated enemies often appear in the V and get stuck there. You can 
try to wait for them to fall, but others then come at you and you may have to 
entrap/kill them and it's a bit sticky. Best to be sure the V is unoccupied 
before dropping in.

Head right for the first gold and then back left. Wait a second left of the 
ladder, then dig right so the guy on the left will get entrapped but not 
killed. Go to the left edge, get the gold, and walk back over the entrapped 
guy, up and left. Wait for everyone to get on the ladder to follow you. Lead 
them to the very UL and then go right on the rope. Drop down, dig to get to 
the two gold in the box and dig and drop again.

If you can get to the right side and keep your enemies on the left, you're 
done. And you can. Go up the long right ladder so you're level with the 3 
golds in the middle box. The enemies will look for you just left of there. Go 
to the top, left off the rope, get the gold, fall right, and dig into the 
box. Get the gold, fall right and climb up. Position yourself as before to 
draw the enemies away and then go to the top of the ladder. Dig left to get 
to the two UR golds. Then fall and go back up the ladder.

You won't be getting any 5-digit bonuses here unless you finish with >5000 
ticks left. This level gets finished in three parts.

First, go right to get the gold chest and then back left. Dig on each side 
and then go to the left and keep digging right. Make enough holes/wait long 
enough to kill every enemy. Then go up to the cement level and clear 
everything there. When your enemies are all on the level above, drop to the 
right. Then dig 8 holes to get rid of them, on the bottom level.

Now run to the DL and wait for everyone to regenerate and fall off the right. 
Once the last enemy has, you have a straight shot up to get the gold chests. 
Well, you have to zigzag a bit, but your path is unimpeded. The ladder to 
level 6 is on the right.

If you just want to win the level, then you can head to the UR, fall in and 
dig a hole to get out when some bad guys get close. A bunch of them will fall 
into the restricted area. One will get trapped in the hole you dug. You can 
repeat this to clear the area of everyone and get a 10000 sealing bonus and 
then take care of the rest.

Otherwise go right and wait at the base of the long stairs. Three guys should 
come to follow you. Lead them up to the top and fall left. Then go right and 
up and right and dig to get the gold in the U-shaped pit. Dig to get to the 
bottom and this time go up the long ladder and all the way right and wait. 
Fall down when three guys are on the rope and at least two should fall in.

Now you can probably lead anyone else with gold on a merry chase so he'll 
eventually get rid of it, and you can get whoever's left to fall in the pit 
easily enough too. That gets you 10000 points.

You may be a bit pressed for time now, so I recommend a quick way through to 
be digging over the suspended gold(L of the tall ladder, center square) and 
falling to the ground and going up and collecting each gold. When you get the 
final one(UL) you can walk right and then up the ladder that appeared to 
advance.

You can try for the 20k bonus but it is a bit of a gamble. What you need to 
do to start out is, clear the right. Get the gold on the edge, then D-L-U-L 
across the rope. Drop onto the next gold and wait for the enemies to lump at 
the center top ladder.

Go to the UL and wait. If you want to be sure of getting the gold, go 4E and 
dig R, left, dig R, left, dig R. You don't want to dig the final hole next to 
the ladder because enemies will get stuck. Not only will this lose you the 
bonus, but it will lose you the ability to get back to the top clearly as 
well. You want to stick the bad guys in the bottom bit for as long as 
possible.

You may have to get them to loop around to follow you if you're trying for 
20k. But when you get the gold, loop back to the left and go up. Pause when 
you're 1/2-level with the block to the right, with the gold in the pit. The 
bad guys will turn to the right. When they're going up the ladder, tap up and 
the ones that can go right into the corner, will. Go back down and repeat, 
and everyone will be trapped away.

Clear out the gold on the center cement bit--dig over them and fall in. One 
bad guy may escape, but he'll never catch up to you. Dig in the UL to fall 
onto the beam with two gold. Below there you need a bit of good digging.

others, and take the stairs out of this level.

The bad guys swarm enough in this level that you don't even want to worry too 
much about the 10000 bonus. Basically if you can sucker everyone over to one 
side and then run to the left for the big dig, more power to you. But trying 
to force it will probably get you killed. You're probably better off going 
for the halftime bonus.

I advise L-U-L to get the gold there and then going back to the left. If an 
enemy follows you, let him. Clear out the DR by getting the top of the golds 
first then digging down. Dig on each side of the ladder before going up, and 
when you do you can clear out the top. If you managed to lump the enemies 
together, now might be a good time to perform the dig in the DL, for the 
entombed gold. If not, you can probably dig the enemies up and let them 
regenerate anyway.

Once you've gotten the entombed gold, sit and wait. The bad guys will go over 
to the right and you can get the DL gold. You can fend them off with digging 
to get the suspended gold in the UL--just dig over it and drop in. You can 
probably scramble for everything else. The exit is in the UR.

This doesn't look like a level where you can get the no-kill bonus in such 
close quarters, but in fact you can. With a bit of precision you can get the 
double-time bonus too.

The first thing to do is go up to get the third gold piece, then dig right 
and fall and repeat that. The two enemies on the left should be close 
together. Now dig two squares to the left for them to fall in--they should be 
4-5 blocks away. Then you can run all the way back up. Grab the gold that's 
just below the overhang, and dig in the center. Now you can keep digging 
straight down to pick up more gold. Don't forget the piece in the DR part of 
the left side.

Back up again using the same trick you did as before. You may have to dig in 
the center but this time, after digging again, dig at the right edge. This'll 
take you to the right side. Dig to the bottom to get the chest there and work 
your way back up. You may have to dig right, go across a ladder and dig right 
to get rid of enemies for the moment but it should work. You may have to 
repeat this at the top to pick up the stray gold pieces but then you can wait 
for the enemies at the top, dig holes to get by them and walk up the flashing 
ladder to level 10.

I decided not to worry about not getting a dig bonus here. While the only 
remotely esoteric gold-grab is on the left, where you have the following 
dilemma:

$
X1
 2XX
$
3X

$

The rest is not too bad except for lining your enemies up. Remember you can 
wait at the very bottom for any monsters in the UL to drop and follow, 
leaving you to climb up the UL.

You can work your way around the enemy that gets in the left, and then you'll 
want to go to the top and immediately dig a bunch of holes to catch any stray 
enemies that go along the top. They tend to regenerate in the UL where they 
will be harmless. From there you just have to watch that any drops you make 
won't put you to the left of a descending enemy. Also, you can save a bit of 
time by digging as follows in the platform just below the top:

$ 1XX
XX2

You'll still have to backtrack up after you fall, but you can dig through in 
just two trips, which is not too bad. Dig your enemies into oblivion so that 
when they are all regenerated in the UL, you can wait in the DR and they will 
fall to the right, leaving you a clear path up and left.

If one still has a gold chest(for whatever reason) you can probably drop in 
to the DL and dig the appropriate number of holes on each side of you.

This level seems complex, but really you just need to do the same thing over 
and over a few times. You can lump the enemies together eventually and then 
take care of them. You can only take out one of the squares of two gold 
pieces at a time, and there's a real risk of getting trapped or impeded at 
the bottom. But for each of the linked squares, you get the gold the same 
way.

At the start you need to dig right, collect the gold(don't worry about to the 
left--you'll get it later,) go up and dig left. You can dig into the UR of 
the boxes. You may have to wait a bit in this box but if you do, the enemies 
will lump together. Dig again and they'll actually retreat to the left. Climb 
up and go left. Dig three holes to the left, wait, and when they fall in, run 
over them. You may want to get the second-left of the boxes here. That allows 
a climb back UR where you can also dig right to get the gold in the DR box 
and the gold you passed by at the start.

The bad guys should congeal back where they started but if not you may want 
to climb partially up on one of the ladders in the middle UR-moving corridor 
when you know an enemy is trapped and killed.

You will need to repeat the trick of digging 3 holes in a row and running 
over 2 more times--once for the center box and once for the one right of 
that. Finally you can dig for the left box. You'd have gotten yourself killed 
before that, trapped in the DL with an enemy, but now you can wait for it to 
go up the second stairs. Dig right and walk up and dig right and you can go 
UR to the next level.

A little snake oil should get you this with a 10000 bonus. You need to get a 
good start, and you can accomplish this by digging left immediately. You can 
dig right after passing over the enemy but it's not necessary. Go to the top, 
dig left to enter the 8, and get the gold there. Head to the bottom if you 
like--you need to synchronize the enemies--and go back up top and dig right 
twice to walk over the enemies and fall to the right.

The other enemy should come falling down a rope, which is your cue to run UR 
past him. Clear out the right side of the 8 and go back up when the enemy on 
the right falls down again. That leaves only the center.

Fall into the center. The enemy there will shift right. Push left and hold 
near the end of your fall. Lead the enemy counterclockwise a cycle. 
Eventually he'll get far enough behind he'll reverse course--when you're in 
the UR. Dig left, get his gold and run up the stairs.

You can probably get a seal bonus or a no-kill bonus here. Given how much 
easier the first is, and how tricky it may be to get the second, you can 
guess my recommended course of action for the first try even though the 
instructions below spell out how to get both bonuses. Basically, to get 
through quickly, kill enemies with impunity.

Killed enemies appear in the UR and so it may be worth it just to pack them 
off right away. However, you can start with a relatively easy pickoff of the 
UL bad guy by getting the gold to the left, going up the stairs, digging left 
and getting the gold, and going RURUR and digging right. Fall right twice. 
The enemy will fall into the 2-pit to the left.

Now to get the next bad guy by climbing up the stairs and digging right. You 
may have to time things a bit so that you don't meet him right at the top, 
and you may have to go down and up after digging the hole. However, once 
you've gotten him in the hole there are lots of ways to kill him off. You can 
run right and dig left and go up the ladder a bit and down to delay him long 
enough to fall in.

You may also be able to stand in the DR after this, dig left, let him fall in 
and then climb UR and he will follow you. In this case you can dispose of him 
as you disposed of the other enemy. While this is time-consuming, it allows 
you to take care of the rest of the level with relative ease. And since you 
can only get the seal bonus once there's no point in sealing a few guys in 
the UR and shifting them to the DL.

The best bet now is to clear out most of the UL. Note the following 
structure:

$
X1
 2$
XX

Dig 1 and 2 to pick off one more gold chest than you thought you would--AND 
avoid getting kicked back to the bottom of the structure and/or falling on 
top of the one enemy. From there you can dig again. One gold chest will 
remain. Leave it 'til the end.

If you need to, drop the enemy into the 2-pit. Also if you need to, get the 
gold in the DR. Now for the UR. You can dig the enemy out of there and let 
him follow you where you can trap him with the others, or you can just dig 
him out, dig another hole at the top and sneak in to dig a hole over the UR 
gold piece.

That leaves the final DL gold piece, and once you get it stairs will appear 
to the left.

Of course you can shorten this process by just killing the bad guys you find 
but I wanted to spell out how to do things without errors.

It's possible to get the full 20k bonus although you may just settle for 10. 
The key is the order in which you get things. Go left. Wait for the 
firecracker to fall from the rope and wait another second. Then get the gold 
piece to the left and go back down. If all goes well the firecrackers should 
be on their way to congregating in the DR corner. Let them. Stand 1R of the 
top of the right ladder. Let your enemies fall, fall right, and let the rest 
fall. R-U-L-U(the ladder that doesn't reach the ground. You actually can 
climb it.) Now dig over the 3x2 cave:

XX1234
XX567X
XX89XX
XXaXXX
   XXX
$ $XXX

Fall to the bottom and again egg your enemies over. Now you should be able to 
fall and get one of the gold pieces. It doesn't matter which. The hunt will 
probably be on now as some enemy will probably grab a chest. You may have to 
give these guys a good  chase--but again, drop from the lower rope, wait, go 
to the DR and pick off any remaining suspended gold chest. Eventually the 
enemies will let go of their gold, you can take it, and you can advance with 
the 20000 bonus.

There's no sin of course in trapping an enemy or killing one in order to 
survive though of course.

I'm having trouble getting either bonus here as the UR is too well guarded. 
But you can still make it through quickly enough.

For the first part you need to push left. Get on the corkscrew structure and 
climb to the top to get all the gold there. Fall left to clear out that side-
-climb up and fall right at the second ladder(upper bit) to get the gold that 
seems suspended, but not quite. Dig left as you go right, and when in the DR 
you may want to dig left too to get rid of enemies.

Enemies regenerate at the very top and fall left instead of taking the stairs 
down, and in this way you can get around them. Just wait for them to fall off 
and then after cleaning out the top in their absence(go left, then right, 
then dig to avoid the guys climbing back up,) take the spiral to the center. 
Work your way out by digging to get to the bottom. You may need to get the 
DR-most gold chest. Dig your way to get to the middle structure and the 
snaking stairs to level 16.

Guess that 20k bonus is sort of forced on you here, eh? This looks sparse and 
forbidding but it's really not a bad level at all. Go left immediately, up 
and fall right so you're near the one gold piece. Wait around, fall right 
when everyone's on the ladder, and go up the right ladder. Level with the 
ropes on each side. This will always kick the enemies back left. Go up and 
fall right and drop down to get the gold just out of your reach now. You have 
a few smash-and-grab missions from this location, which is your base.

1. Up, left, fall down and go right.
2. U-L-U(gold)-right and fall onto the gold in space-L.
3. U-L-U-R-U-fall all the way right to the edge, U-L-fall down-R-U-fall left 
2x and fall down onto 2 gold pieces.

Wait for the enemies to come by and then climb the ladder. Fall left when 
everyone's on it.

Now on the left ladder, where the top rung is where to stay to fake the 
enemies out after falling down. Make sure everyone's on the right ladder 
before continuing.The suspended UL gold is not hard to get. Then go L U R U 
and fall right 3x. Then fall left and work your way to the center ladder. 
You'll get one gold chest at the top. Fall right and fall down. You should be 
able to run left and work your way falling down ropes and climbing up ladders 
easily enough(R-R-U-L-L-U.)

I found this to be such a hodgepodge that I just plowed my way through 
although I can detail how to get by some narrow scrapes below. You will 
probably need a dig or two due to the tight quarters in the DL but at the 
start a no-dig policy works well. So if something seems to have bad timing, 
just dig a bit to but breathing space.

R-U-R and get the gold, then go back left. Climb up and fall left. Dig left 
as the enemy approaches and as he is about to drop on you, fall left. One 
enemy down in the daisies but you can't do the same to others sadly.

One enemy will be chasing you. Give him the runaround if he has a gold 
chest(or just dig if 10k is good enough,) then let him follow you into the 
niche in the DL. Dig left to fall on the ladder and then go right and down to 
get the gold. Your enemy will drop. Circle around to get past him and re-
entrap him in the DL. Now you may have to shake an enemy(who may have gold) 
to get further. you may let him keep the gold as you'll be getting guys to 
follow you again, but in any case you will want to run right along the bottom 
and up the ladder. Stay level with what's on the other side of the wall to 
fool an enemy and then let the other one follow you around 'til he loses his 
gold. Dig to get the two gold in the 3x2(wait until people milling in the DL 
are against the left wall) and then bring the bad guy back over.

Now you can wait at the base of that ladder for the enemy to fall at you. Get 
a big lead for the DR gold--R, drop D, R, D, L and now go UL and fall onto 
the suspended gold and you should be able to climb your way out.

You probably won't get a double-time bonus without entrapping.

A fun level where you can probably either entrap your opponents or not-kill 
them and the first is much easier. Go to the right to sucker everyone over 
there and then give them the slip(dig a hole or two if need be) and run back 
left. You can then leave a couple digs behind you so that you can get into 
the rope part. Get the gold and immediately dig your way out. Enemies may 
come in after you--dig to the right and fall through. They can take the rope 
over the hole.

Now if you get out you can just dig as you go to the left, letting enemies 
drop in. Eventually they'll all get stuck in the center, leaving you to clean 
out the rest. The only things that should worry you are: drop on the 
suspended gold in the right, dig right, get out. Now get everything except 
the two golds near the right edge.

For these drop on the upper, dig, and drop onto the lower. A ladder will 
appear because you got the last gold. You can walk over it but what about the 
other one that appeared? You'll have to release your enemies again. You can 
again dig holes for them or just run away to the bottom right as before, 
before you dig left. Heading left and up the stairs should allow you plenty 
of time to dig right at the top and get the flashing ladder.

A level that's easy once you see it though you don't get a bonus for sealing 
off all enemies. Dig and drop left twice. Go left but don't fall. When the 
final enemy hooks onto the rope, drop off to the left. Everyone will try to 
fall on you. Run left, up and right and fall over the gold pieces. Now to dig 
to get one(the right gold.)

This creates a 3-wide hole instead of a 2-wide, so you can dig back to your 
starting position. Repeat, mirrored, for the left gold.

Go to the UR and now for another tricky dig.

Here the initial mess can be sorted out by a few exact moves. Run directly 
left. UL when past the first ladder. Get the gold on the edge and dig where 
it was. Fall down when the enemy almost touches you. Run back right. Fall 
right and stay at the ladder base. U-R-U-R(2 squares) and wait for an enemy 
to get close. Fall down. Then go LULULU and back right to get one gold, then 
L-U-R to get more. Fall down to the right and get more gold. R-U-L for 2 more 
and R-U-R and drop into the pit. Go left, dig right.

Now drop onto the 3-rope below. Fall from there onto the 1-rope, dig right, 
and circle back up around after getting the gold so you are on a level with 
the platform touching the left edge. Your enemies won't chase you now. With 
them lumped together you can lure them right, drop, and go off to the left as 
before.

Only this time you go to the UL, at the 1-rope. Fall left and go L-U to get 
the final gold. Fall down and then wait for everyone to fall after you before 
going right and U-L-U-R-U onto the flashing stairs.

Fall right for one gold and all the way left for another. Go back up to the 
top and head right. Go down the stairs in the center structure all the way--
fall and grab the gold(left and right.) Then go back up and left and fall for 
another gold. The enemy should have you pinned in, but no fears. Go up the 
stairs and back down when the enemy is roping over the brick. He'll fall, you 
can go U-R-D for the final gold piece, and then you can go U-L-R-U to get the 
remaining gold and get out.

Fall right onto the rope. Get the gold to the right. Fall left and right. Dig 
the square you last fell on and go left immediately, then back right 
immediately. Collect all the gold as you climb up. Two enemies should be 
together. Let them follow you to 1U1L of the 1-rope and fall right and drop. 
They'll fall after you, making the next bit(over to the left) easy.

For the final bit release the fellow in the DL. If you like you can lead him 
on a chase clockwise but it may alert the other enemies so it may just be 
simpler to dig a hole. However, once you have got the gold, a ladder opens up 
access to the UL.

You can get a huge bonus with the right moves at the start. Whatever you do, 
be careful not to let enemies fall in the DL pit with two gold(no way to win) 
and try not to let a flashing enemy fall in the 3-pit where one bad guy 
starts.

Go left for a gold then fall right. The enemoy will come at you instead of 
left/right to get gold. L-D-R onto the ladder. Climb down a bit, fall right 
and go left a square.

Dig right and drop right. Wait for the other two guys to fall in. Go to the 
top here and dig over the top of the golds. Get it, fall left, dig and 
collect the three other golds. Dig to get out, fall, R U L(fall) L U L Dig-
left to get on a gold, dig-left and fall and fall into the left. Dig right. 
Get another gold. Stand over the final gold, dig left, fall down and go L-U-
R. If this maneuver is too risky, dig and climb back up and just pick off the 
chest that way.

OK, forget about the no-kill bonus because you have to get some bad guys to 
regenerate to solve this level. Go to the left, up and right, and dig as your 
enemies come at you. Go to the main UL ledge and wait for enemies to 
regenerate. If one does just UR of you, go to the top of the ladder and fall 
on him. If there's one UL of you, dig left to make sure. Fall on the center 
enemy and go right, so you are in the top center.

If this doesn't work, go to the bottom and try again. This is a rather tricky 
dig and the top two rows should be done with precision.

You've got the toughest one. Now fall to the left and take care of what's 
there--kill anyone who gets in the way until they're all on the right. Fall 
onto the UL gold, then dig the 3 rightmost parts of the top platform, the 3 
below that, etc., until just above the first gold. Then dig as follows:

     H
 $12XH
XXX3XH
XXX$XH

Now go to the right, wiping enemies from there as they appear. Again fall on 
the UR gold but now you have a different puzzle. Dig the 5 leftmost on each 
platform, right to left. That gets you:

XX4XXXX
X$$XXXX

Then dig the 2 leftmost on each platform until you can dig and just get the 
final gold.

Things get chaotic if you don't keep the enemies bottled up. Eventually 
they'll probably go into the U, but eventually you run out of time.

Go left. Dig the leftmost square. Dig the one below that and the one below 
that. Wait for the first square to fill in. Dig the DL square, go U/R and dig 
above the gold. Fall and go left. Go to the UL.

Dig right, down, dig right. Wait for the UL hole to fill in, dig the final DR 
hole, and come around to get one of the suspended golds. Go immediately back 
up the left side ladder. Repeat, so the enemies stay in place.

Fall into the U for gold and dig right. Run right as you dig left. When 
everyone's in a hole, fall onto the left suspended gold. Be prepared to dig 
more holes and get the right suspended gold or a gold on the platform in the 
air.

When there are two enemies around you can take care of the rest without much 
trouble. Fall down making sure to pass over a gold chest. Dig a couple of 
holes and then dig right to get to the very bottom. Walk back up. Next time 
you dig holes for your enemy, walk L-U-R and drop onto the other gold. If you 
have enough time now you can try to get enemies to regenerate all in the U. 
If they appear a bit left of the U it should happen as well. Though you may 
just want to get through level 24. Once you do, you've pretty much won; the 
other levels just repeat themselves.
