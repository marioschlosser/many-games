1. NOTES
×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•

This document will provide you with everything you need to know in order 
to officially win the game of Pitfall. Some believe that the object is 
to get as many points as you can in the 20 alotted minutes, without 
losing all your lives. I was once one of them. Then I discovered that 
the object is to find ALL the treasure in the jungle, in the 20 minutes 
allowed. At first I thought it was impossible, and it really is quite 
difficult. If and when you do win the game, there will not be much more 
than one minute remaining on the clock.

One more thing I'd like to add before I get started. This is not my 
favorite Atari game, in fact, I think it's rather overrated. But I can 
beat this game, and not many people can do so. I just wanted to be able 
to win this game, but I could not find any help. So I made a numbered 
list from 1 to 256 and wrote down all the treasures, shortcuts, and 
traps throughout the game. This info does not do much good just sitting 
in my notebook, so I'm doing this for anyone that's interested.

3. Walkthrough
×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•×•

There are 256 total screens in the game. The starting screen will be 
called #1, one screen to the left will be called #2, and so on. There 
are 8 of each treasure scattered throughout the 256 screen. None of them 
are underground. Going through one underground screen is like going 
through 3 regular screens, and the only possible way to get all 36 
treasures is to utilize the underground shortcuts.

Here is a step-by-step procedure on how to get all the treasures. 
Remember, we're going leftward. There is no way of knowing exactly which 
screen we're on, other than counting, or recognizing the patterns of 
treasure. I just post them to show progress.

1. On the starting screen (#1), go down the ladder, and take the 
shortcut. This will take you to screen #7.

2. Go across 11 screens to #18. Do not take any shortcuts until there. 
There will be Money Bag #1.

3. Go ahead 3 more screens to #21. Take the shortcut, which will take 
you to #30.

4. Go back above ground, and go RIGHT 2 screens. Get Diamond Ring #1

5. Proceed again to the left, 4 screens ahead, to #32. Make sure you 
don't take the underground at #31, that's a trap. Remember, the second 
one. Take this shortcut, where you'll end at screen #47.

6. This is the first "stretch" of being above ground. In it, you will 
come across Money Bag #2, Diamond Rings #2 and #3, and Golds #1 and #2.

7. The screen with the second Gold is #64. Go left 6 more screens, to 
#70. Take this shortcut.

8. Here's an even longer stretch of being above ground. The next 
treasures are:
Money Bag #3
Gold #3
Silver #1
Diamond Ring #4
Gold #4
Money Bag #4
Silver #2
Gold #5
Silver #3
Silver #4
Silver #5 (screen #137)

9. From screen #137, proceed left two more screens to #139, and take 
this shortcut. It is the longest useful shortcut in the game; it takes 
you all the way to #163.

10. Go RIGHT 3 screens to get Money Bag #5. Then turn around and go back 
left. This is the final long stretch of being above ground, and it's the 
longest. This time, the treasures are in this order:
Money Bag #6
Gold #6
Diamond Ring #5
Diamond Ring #6
Silver #6
Money Bag #7
Money Bag #8
Diamond Ring #7
Silver #7
Silver #8
Diamond Ring #8
Gold #7 (screen #227)

11. Almost there! Just one more Gold and the game is over. From screen 
#227, go left eleven more screens to #238. Count carefully, it's easy to 
lose track. Take this shortcut, which takes you to #244.

12. Go left four more screens, and that's it. There's Gold #8, on screen 
#248, and you should have them all!

The maximum possible score is 114000. But that is extremely difficult, 
because sometimes logs sneak up on you and take away a few points.

4. Tips

Unless you're going for time records, there's no need to be in a hurry. 
Although there will be roughly 1 minute remaining for the average player 
when it gets the last treasure, waiting for pits to close and open back 
up, or alligators' mouths to open and close, only takes about 2 or 3 
seconds. There is still plenty of time for several unnecessary stops.

If you are running across a pit that opens and closes, and you feel it's 
going to be a close call, jump for it! It could be the difference 
between life and death.

Now it's time for my first attempt at ASCII art:
    ___________________
   /                   \
  /     \     \    \    \
 a|    ¯°   ¯°   ¯°    |e
  \      b    c     d   /
   \___________________/

If you haven't figured it out, that's an alligator pit. Probably the 
biggest cause of death in the game. Here are some pointers on jumping 
across them. The 'points' are the end of the alligators' heads (not the 
mouth), which are always safe to stand on. It is only safe to stand on 
the mouths when they are shut.

--One jump length is equal to the distance from 'e' to 'd', 'd' to 'c', 
or 'c' to 'b'.

--The jump from 'b' to 'a', or 'a' to 'b' for that matter, is not a safe 
jump. You will land in the water, so don't do it.

--In my opinion, the best way of doing it is (from right to left): Jump 
from 'e' to 'd', and wait for the mouths to shut. Then jump across all 
the way to 'a'.

--There is enough time to jump across all three while the mouths are 
shut. But there is very little room for error, so I recommend only 
jumping across two at a time.
