HOW TO PLAY
                                ===========
Even upon first glance, Lemmings doesn't appear to be a difficult game to 
learn. The first thing we will do to get you into the Lemmings groove is 
familiarize you with all the game's screens. These include the title screen, 
the screen you see just before entering a level, and the actual field of 
play. Listed below are those screens and Reasonable Facsimiles of them, in 
the order I just ran them off in.


     1. The Title Screen

         F1-----------o  F2-----------o  F3-----------o  o-------------o
         |            |  |            |  |            |  | (up)        |

                         o------------o  o------------o

     -> 1-Player is simply the PC version's way of saying this is how to
        start the game. There is no 2-player mode in Lemmings (although that
        would be VERY interesting to see implemented). In the Macintosh
        version, this button says Let's Go! Press F1 to start on the first
        level (or the level you have entered a password for).

     -> New Level will not let you make new levels as you might think -
        though there is a utility that lets you do just that for Lemmings.
        This is where you enter passwords. Make sure you enter the ten-letter 
        code correctly or you won't be able to go to the level you were    
        after.

     -> I left the F3 box blank because that's usually how I see it. However,
        if you press F3, you will see that blank space, a musical note, and
        "FX" there. You can toggle between no music at all, music and sound
        effects, or just sound effects. There is no option for music only.

     -> Press Up and Down to choose the difficulty you want to play at. If
        you choose a difficulty rating without entering a password, you will
        start on level 1 of that set of levels.

     -> Press Esc to leave Lemmings when your brain is totally destroyed by
        the intense difficulty or when the real world beckons you.

     -> F4 will let you select and calibrate the control method of your
        choice. I recommend the mouse.


     2. The Vital Statistics Screen

           o------------------------------------------------------o
           |                                                      |
           |                       (map)                          |
           |                                                      |
           o------------------------------------------------------o

                           Number of Lemmings  ??

                           % To Be Saved       ??

                           Release Rate        ??

                           Time         ? Minutes

                           Rating              --

     -> The map gives you a small-scale model of the level, giving you the
        opportunity to soak it all in and see if you're ready for it.

     -> There can be anywhere from eighty whole Lemmings in a level to just
        one. This is the first number you see there.

     -> Out of however many Lemmings you are required to save, a certain
        percentage of them have to make it to a designated point intact. This
        percentage is given to you in the % To Be Saved blank. Often, it will
        be in the range of 10-100%.

     -> "Release rate" is a term for how fast the Lemmings will fall out of
        the hatch at the beginning of the level. The number will always be in
        the range of 1 to 99. 1 is the absolute slowest setting - about one
        Lemming every two-and-a-half seconds. At 99, they will flood out
        uncontrollably. This is a setting best used to empty the remaining
        Lemmings out of the hatch once a path has been forged, but several
        levels start out at this speed, and you'll have to work with it,
        because the release rate cannot be lowered past the level's initial
        setting.

     -> Time amounts in this game are always listed in whole integers. The
        amount of time you have to beat a level may be anywhere from a paltry
        one minute to a whopping nine.

     -> Ratings are simply to tell you what difficulty a level has been
        deemed to be. The four difficulty settings in this game are Fun,
        Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.


     3. The Field of Play

        --------------------------------------------------------------





                          a portion of the gaming area




        --------------------------------------------------------------
       | + | - |CLI|FLO|BOM|BLK|BLD|BSH|MIN|DIG|   |   |              |
       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |PSE|NUK|   mini-map   |
       |???|???|???|???|???|???|???|???|???|???|   |   |              |
        --------------------------------------------------------------

     -> The plus and minus signs represent the release rate. By clicking the 
        corresponding button, you can either increase or decrease it. Recall
        that you can't put it below the initial speed for that level, nor can
        you put it above 99.

     -> CLI stands for Climber. When applied to a Lemming, that Lemming will
        take on the ability to scale walls. This ability lasts until the end
        of the level.

     -> FLO stands for Floater. When a Lemming who is a floater falls from a
        large distance, it will deploy a parachute-like umbrella that allows
        them to fall any distance without splatting. Like the ability to
        climb, this lasts until the end of a level.

     SPECIAL NOTE: When a Lemming has both the ability to climb and float, it
     will be labeled an Athlete by the game. I use this term as well, so it
     would be a good idea for you to learn it as well. An Athlete is just a
     Lemming that is both a climber and a floater.

     -> BOM stands for Bomber. Any Lemming that is made a bomber immediately
        affects a five-second fuse. Although usually applied to blockers,
        situations do arise where you will have to make walkers into bombers
        as well. At the end of the five-second fuse, the Lemming blows up.
        Generally, you should try to use as few that you are given as you 
        can. Lemmings can't bomb through steel under normal circumstances.

     -> BLK stands for Blocker. Any Lemming that is made a blocker is frozen
        in place semi-permanently (special situations sometimes make blockers
        into walkers). Any walker or other Lemming that runs into a blocker
        will turn around and go in the other direction. Blockers are not
        always available to you or cannot be used in the interest of saving
        enough Lemmings, so creative ways of encasing groups of Lemmings may
        sometimes have to be found.

     -> BLD stands for Builder. One builder can construct a 45-degree bridge
        comprised of twelve tiles. If you have sound effects on, you will
        hear a clicking when a builder is about to run out of tiles, in which
        case you need to listen should you have to keep building a bridge.
        I would consider builders the most common task assigned to Lemmings,
        so they play a very important role in getting Lemmings to the exit.

     -> BSH stands for Basher. Bashers punch through walls in a horizontal
        line until they get to the end of the wall. The other Lemmings can
        then walk through the narrow tunnel that the basher makes. Lemmings
        can't bash through steel under normal circumstances.

     -> MIN stands for Miner (not the under-18 kind - like a coal miner).
        With pick-ax in hand, a Lemming will mine a diagonal tunnel downward 
        in the direction it was facing when you clicked on it. Lemmings can't
        mine through steel under normal circumstances.

     -> DIG stands for ... well, Digger. Any Lemming turned into a digger
        immediately takes to digging a tunnel straight down through the
        terrain below it. Lemmings can't dig through steel under normal
        circumstances.

     -> PSE stands for Pause, which in this game has an icon that looks like
        a tiny set of paws. (Get the joke? Yeah, I know, it's bad.)

     -> NUK stands for Nuke. This is to be used in situations when no more
        Lemmings can possibly be saved or when you feel like looking at a
        thoroughly amusing pyrotechnic displays on days other than the Fourth
        of July. When you double-click this button or press F12, all the
        Lemmings onscreen become bombers with five-second fuses above their
        heads. Lemmings will also cease coming out of the hatch if they are
        still in the process of doing so. After five seconds, every single
        Lemming will blow up in an impressive fireworks display, and you will
        be sent to the accountability screen, which tells you how many were
        saved and accounted for.

     SPECIAL NOTE: The question marks in the field-of-play model represent 
     the number values that are in those boxes while you are playing.

Now that you know what everything on all those initially befuddling screens 
is all about, it's safe to introduce you to the basic concept of Lemmings. 
You are given a set amount of Lemmings per level. Out of those many or few 
Lemmings, you must save a certain percentage of them. If you're not sure how 
many Lemmings encompass the percentage provided, convert the percentage to be 
saved to a decimal number (.xx) and multiply the total number of Lemmings by 
the decimal number you got.

As you've seen, you have several tools that will help you get the Lemmings to 
the exit, because they can't do it on their own. Were they left up to natural 
selection, every one of those Lemmings would mindlessly walk off ledges and 
into bottomless pits, water, acid, lava, and all the other environmental 
hazards interspersed throughout the game's 120 levels. You are their savior, 
their divine intervention. By giving them things to do that are productive 
and will lead them to the paradise behind the exit, you are like a god to 
them. You won't really get a reward or anything for beating the game, aside 
from the inner satisfaction of having beaten all 120 levels.

That is basically all you have to do. Of course, the game isn't always 
straight-up building, bashing, and bombing. If that were the case, it'd be 
way too easy. You will have to find creative ways to use what is given to 
you. Most tools have more uses than what is already obvious. I am the only 
person I know who has beaten this game. Hopefully, my friends and relatives 
who before were totally stumped should now gain all the knowledge they need 
to take on this game - and you should too, I hope.

                        HELPFUL TIPS AND TECHNIQUES
                        ===========================
In Lemmings, there is no affair that can be taken (1) lightly or (2) slowly. 
Most levels will require you to be focusing on multiple facets of gameplay at 
once. No amount of mousework can prepare you for some of what is ahead. If 
you're confused and can't figure out for the life of you why the solution to 
a level just flat-out is not working, this section contains some pointers and 
ways to get yourself out of the rut of slowness and do things fast. Nimble 
fingers are always a plus when doing some of these. Also, this section 
doesn't include stuff like using two blockers to hold in a bunch of Lemmings. 
Any fool could figure that out.

-----------
1. Hot Keys
-----------
"Hot keys" is computer slang for keyboard shortcuts that are more efficient 
than doing things with the mouse. In Lemmings, hot keys are not just more 
efficient: they're practically a hallelujah chorus in their own right. With 
hot keys, you can assign jobs faster and select tasks or raise and lower 
release rate while the game is paused - something you can't do with the 
mouse. Here is a listing of what each hot key instantly jumps to:

  F1 - lower release rate (hold down to do it faster)
  F2 - raise release rate
  F3 - climbers
  F4 - floaters
  F5 - bombers
  F6 - blockers
  F7 - builders
  F8 - bashers
  F9 - miners
  F10 - diggers
  F11 - pause the game
  F12 - Armageddon (nuke)

--------------------------
2. Surveying the Landscape
--------------------------
Before each level starts, pause the game and get a good long look at the 
terrain. During this time, you can see how much of each tool you've been 
given, find traps you might need to be on the lookout for, formulate 
strategies, etc. This is always a great thing to do before levels that seem 
reasonably difficult.

----------------------------------------
3. Milking Bridges For All They're Worth
----------------------------------------
Wait for a builder to run out of tiles, then let him walk a little bit before 
continuing the bridge (but not enough to fall off the bridge). You will get 
quite a bit more length out of your bridges this way, though they won't be as 
tall as perfectly shaped bridges.

-----------------------------------------------
4. The Ground Under Me Is Gone! I'm A Free Man!
-----------------------------------------------
Mine or bash the ground under a blocker to make it a walker again. This keeps 
you from having to use bombers in situations where you have to save more than 
that will allow.

-----------------------
5. Zigzagging Staircase
-----------------------
Building zigzagging staircases is the most efficient way to get out of deep 
holes when you don't have a decent amount of climbers or other tasks 
pertaining to your situation.

--------------------
6. Breaking the Fall
--------------------
When you don't have floaters available to you, you can dig at the edge of 
certain ledges to take a good chunk out of the falling distance, which might 
otherwise cause a lot of Lemmings to go KER-SPLAT!

----------------
7. Holding Cells
----------------
This is one of the special techniques that you will use most often throughout 
the course of the game. To create a holding cell, have one Lemming start 
digging a hole. When that hole is deep enough that the digger won't build out 
of it, have him build to cut the hole off at a certain point. This will hold 
as many Lemmings as are in the level until a zigzagging staircase is built to 
help them all escape. The only problem with this is that you have to build 
the zigzagging staircase in the right direction or they might all go off on 
the wrong path and die!
  Another way to make a holding cell is to have two miners mine in opposite 
directions and have each one build when the tunnels are deep enough.

--------------------------
8. Turning Around On Steel
--------------------------
If you need someone to turn the other way while walking on steel, have him 
build one or two tiles, then mine to cut off the bridge. The builder/miner 
will make a dent in the steel and start walking off in the other direction.

--------------------
9. Steel Digging 101
--------------------
In the How to Play section, I noted for each type of digging Lemming that 
they cannot dig through steel under normal circumstances. This refers to 
trying to dig/bash/mine through a solid chunk of steel. If you dig/bash/mine 
through steel and another destructible surface at the same time, you will go 
through the steel portion of the tunnel without problems. There are some 
levels where it is necessary to employ the "cheating" tactic of partially 
going through steel.

---------------
10. Bridge Wall
---------------
You shouldn't have to do this very often, but if you are at a loss for 
blockers and there is absolutely no way to hold in a restless bunch of 
Lemmings - you can't make a holding cell due to thin ground and nothing else 
will work - you can form a bridge wall. A barrier consisting of 10-13 bridges 
has a thick enough base that Lemmings are not able to pass through the foot 
of the stairs as they can with a single bridge. This is a rarely used tactic, 
but one that is necessary to the completion of at least one level in the 
game.

--------------------
11. Over The Blocker
--------------------
In cases where bombing a blocker would cause a gap in the floor that would 
kill Lemmings, you might have to build a zigzagging bridge over some 
blockers. Make sure they come out in the direction you intend for them to or 
many could die needlessly. Builders will automatically turn around if they 
run into a blocker while doing their job.

---------------------
12. Walking Time Bomb
---------------------
Sometimes you will have to make Lemmings bombers as they are walking or doing 
something else when you don't possess any blockers. Some levels require this 
just to give you a hard time. In levels where you have to do this, I will 
clearly indicate the exact point(s) where you should start the timer on a 
walker.

------------------------------------------------------------
13. Today, The Digger Will Be Playing The Part Of The Basher
------------------------------------------------------------
If no bashers are in your inventory, simply make a Lemming into a climber, 
and when they get to the top of a surface, have them dig to create an 
opening. This only works on thin surfaces that are not cut off by a ceiling.

------------------------
14. Pass-Through Blocker
------------------------
If you turn a Lemming into a blocker as soon as he hits the ground below the 
level's starting point, the other Lemmings will at first pass through him and 
continue on to the right, but if for some reason they happen to cross back to 
that blocker, they will turn around when they hit him. You'll use this one A 
LOT.

-------------------------------
15. Gimme A Few Seconds, Please
-------------------------------
If you pause before the hatch opens up, you can squeeze a few more seconds 
out of a level. Opening the hatch takes nearly four seconds, so this pause is 
especially important in those 1-minute levels where every second counts.

These techniques and more will be a great deal of help to you in your journey 
as the Lemmings Savior. If you have intuition and a bit of hindsight, that 
will help you all the more in your quest. When combined with the multitasking 
wonders and general tips seen here, there's no reason you won't be able to 
tackle most levels in Lemmings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             APPENDIX OF TRAPS
                             =================
Have your Lemmings been consistently snared in the same trap over and over 
again, but you can't figure out what on God's green earth the thing that 
they're getting crushed, folded, squished, throttled, or otherwise just 
mutilated by in general might be? That's what this section is here for. 
You'll see all the traps in the game in this section, along with some that 
aren't in any level in the game but are actual parts in the tile sets. Traps 
will be categorized by the tile set they match up with. There is also a 
section for general traps that can be found anywhere.

-----------------------------
General Environmental Hazards
-----------------------------

BOTTOMLESS PITS
These are in every level in the game, though you won't be able to get to most 
of them in some levels. Any time you see black along the bottom of the 
screen, that is where the abyss lies. Lemmings that wander into these endless 
holes are gone forever.

HARMFUL LIQUIDS
Lemmings can't swim (in this game, anyway), so if they fall in any sort of 
liquid, they'll flail their limbs helplessly for a second and then will find 
themselves mired in whatever they've fallen into. Liquids can most often be 
passed by building bridges over them, though in some cases there are other 
ways around. The liquids differ according to their location, and are 
classified in the following chart.

          LOCATION | LIQUID TYPE
     --------------+-----------------
       underground | fresh water
      gold pillars | fresh water
           pastels | acid
              hell | lava
     crystal caves | crystal water

None of the extended tile sets (as seen in 22 Fun, 14 Tricky, 15 Taxing, and 
22 Mayhem) have water or any other sort of liquid in them.

WALLS WITH ARROWS
This is not a trap, per se, but merits a listing in this section because it 
can hamper your progress if you are ill-prepared for it. Arrows indicate that 
you can only dig through a wall in the direction shown. Most often, they will 
be pointing against you, which requires you to go over them (they are hardly 
ever attached to ceilings) and bash or mine through from the other side. 
Again, they're not a trap - just a major inconvenience.

-----------------
Underground Traps
-----------------

STEEL TRAP
Used here not for killing bears, foxes, or other wildlife, but Lemmings. Go 
under them by mining or over them with one builder.

10-TON WEIGHT
If a Lemming steps on the button below one of these things, it's splat time 
for him. You can build over the button if you want.

RETRACTABLE BOULDER
This is a sly trap. There's no button that activates it, so if you're under 
it, it will crush you, even if you try to build over it. In that case, the 
only way to elude this trap is to mine under it, but not so far that escape 
is really hard or impossible, and then bash a straight tunnel out. It's only 
in one level in Lemmings, but you have to watch out for it because it blends 
in so well with the landscape that you may lose ten or more Lemmings before 
you realize what's happened. Being under it also results in one of the 
goriest deaths in the game.

-----------------
Gold Pillar Traps
-----------------

ROPE SNARE
Just don't get a Lemming's foot caught in this. The trip around it can be 
rough if they meet with it. They are often out of the way beyond an exit or 
in an otherwise inaccessible area, so you won't have to deal with them most 
of the time - they seem to have been put in most levels as mere scenery.

NEEDLES
Although the needles are only in one level (like most traps), there are two 
sets of them in that level, and a deadly trap this is. You usually won't get 
hurt if you run into them near the very bottom or top, so just basically 
avoid the very middle. They will shoot out real fast and send a Lemming to 
who-knows-where. Also, they work swiftly and with alarming accuracy, so don't 
let too many Lemmings meet the needles.

------------
Pastel Traps
------------

MASHERS
Equivalent to the underground area's retractable boulder, but these have a 
button to activate them, so they can be built over easily. If a line of, say, 
twenty Lemmings passes over a masher button, seven or eight will die. That's 
roughly 40% of the line, so stay away from mashers if you can.

SHREDDERS
Shredders spin so freely with the wind, but they're not to be toyed with. 
Every inch of muscle fiber, bone, and tissue in a Lemming's body will be 
strewn about if they get too close to one of these. Often, a blocker will be 
able to ward off one of these, but not always. One of the game's hardest 
levels involves these shredders, and you'll know which one it is when I get 
to it.

----------
Hell Traps
----------

FIRE BLOWERS
There is no way to bypass one of these - it's all or nothing. In other words, 
find a way around one. The fire will kill every Lemming in a line that passes 
through it, even at the highest release rate. Lemmings will also suffer if 
they touch a fire blower directly at the source. Keep all this in mind as you 
come around them.

FIRE BOXES
Coals inside the boxes keep the flames ablaze. Lemmings can step right in 
them without the aid of a bridge, so use blockers or another form of defense 
against them. Fortunately, they're usually out of the way, so you won't have 
to deal directly with them very often.

------------------
Crystal Cave Traps
------------------

SLICER
Meeting one of these things means a Lemmings will get cut up into four neat 
portions. I don't recall this one being in any level in the game.

DEMOLECULARIZER
It looks like two balls on steel rods - one under the Lemming, the other 
above it. If you step between them, your molecules will torn apart in a 
terrible mess. There's only one level where you'll see this thing, and it is 
very easy to go around in that level.

LEMMING GHOSTBUSTER TRAP
That's the best I can describe this thing as. When a Lemming steps on the 
Lemming Ghostbuster Trap, they'll get sucked down into it, molecule for 
molecule. Although, like the demolecuarizer, it's only located in one level, 
its placement will mean the difference between whether or not you are able to 
finish the level - MWAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh my, it's hot in here.

There are no traps to be found in the extended tile sets (the four levels 
with different backgrounds than the others).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                WALKTHROUGH
                                ===========


                        T H E   F U N   L E V E L S

-----------------------
Level 1   Just dig!
10 Lemmings (10% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
-----------------------
+ Mostly, these first seven or eight levels are meant as tutorial exercises,
  so in all honesty, you shouldn't really need help with them. But, if you're
  just that desperate and you still can't figure out what's going on, AFTER
  ALL THE EXPLAINING I DID ... well, okay.
+ Have one Lemming dig a hole - anywhere you want. He will eventually make
  his way to the bottom and all the other Lemmings will follow the trail and
  go to the exit. You only need to use one digger (you're given ten) to
  complete the level. After one has reached the exit (10% of ten Lemmings is
  one), you can let the rest follow suit or nuke them all.

----------------------------------------
Level 2   Only floaters can survive this
10 Lemmings (10% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
----------------------------------------
+ As you can see, the distance they will fall from that last column is too
  much for the Lemmings to bear. Make at least one a floater, because that's
  all you need to save. Once one has made it to the exit, you can do what you
  please with the others.

----------------------------------
Level 3   Tailor-made for blockers
50 Lemmings (10% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
----------------------------------
+ There are several points in this level where the Lemmings could easily fall
  to their deaths. You need to place blockers at the points where Lemmings
  could potentially meet their graves. A novice will probably use the maximum
  five blockers needed for the job; experts will probably only need three.

-------------------------------------
Level 4   Now use miners and climbers
10 Lemmings (100% saved)
RR 1    5 minutes
-------------------------------------
+ With the one miner you are given, make him tunnel out of his prison, so to
  speak.
+ Assign a climber to every Lemming and watch as they scale the wall to the
  exit. Remember to save every Lemming - no nukes this time or you'll have to
  do it again.

------------------------------------
Level 5   You need bashers this time
50 Lemmings (10% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
------------------------------------
+ Bash through the pole in front of you and the large cavern wall behind
  that.
+ If you bash at the base of the pyramid fence each time, you'll only have to
  use one basher. (Bashing in the middle of fences is generally not a good
  idea unless I say it is.)

-----------------------------------------
Level 6   A task for blockers and bombers
50 Lemmings (20% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
-----------------------------------------
+ Since they all walk around the same general area in the beginning without
  heading off anywhere else, you can just bomb the first one that comes out
  without making him a blocker.
+ If you're not accustomed to the Walking Time Bomb trick, put a blocker as
  close to the thin pole guarding the exit as you can and then blow him to
  bits. If you can pull it off correctly, it just makes for good practice for
  one of the Tricky levels...

-------------------------------------
Level 7   Builders will help you here
50 Lemmings (50% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
-------------------------------------
+ Build up to the raised platform ahead of you.
+ Build over the pit located in front of the exit. It doesn't matter if a few
  Lemmings get caught in there.

----------------------------------------
Level 8   Not as complicated as it looks
80 Lemmings (95% saved)
RR 88   5 minutes
----------------------------------------
+ Put a blocker near the opening hatch to guide the Lemmings to the exit
  behind it.

--------------------------------------
Level 9   As long as you try your best
80 Lemmings (90% saved)
RR 99   5 minutes
--------------------------------------
+ As soon as the first Lemming hits the ground, turn him into a blocker. The
  others will initially pass through him and go to the right, but once they
  come back around, the blocker will start to do his job. This is a useful
  technique that you need to remember.
+ Bash through the pillar once you're safe from the shredders.

-------------------------------------
Level 10   Smile if you love Lemmings
20 Lemmings (50% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
-------------------------------------
+ Make the first one a blocker so that all other Lemmings are diverted to the
  left.
+ Make the rest floaters. You can nuke after you've saved the minimum amount
  if you want.

----------------------------------------
Level 11   Keep your hair on Mr. Lemming
50 Lemmings (83% saved)
RR 50   5 minutes
----------------------------------------
+ Assign both a climber and a floater to the first two Lemmings out of the
  hatch. From here on out, this combination of climber and floater will be
  referred to as Athlete (the game's terminology, not mine).
+ When the first one is on the ground after surmounting the towering wall and 
  is approaching the exit, make him a blocker.
+ Notice the arrows pointing left on the towering wall. This means you can
  only bash through them in that direction. Knowing that, you know that it's
  the other athlete's job to bash through that wall. Make him do just that.
+ Blow up the blocker so the other Lemmings can make it to the exit once the
  athlete bashes through.

-----------------------
Level 12   Patience
80 Lemmings (50% saved)
RR 99   5 minutes
-----------------------
+ Use the pass-through blocker technique at the beginning so that your flood
  of Lemmings doesn't come back and spill off the edge into oblivion.
+ Bash through the wall.
+ When they fall into the alcove, use some builders to get yourself out of
  there.

---------------------------
Level 13   We all fall down
20 Lemmings (100% saved)
RR 01   3 minutes
---------------------------
+ This is the first level where the slight increase in splat distance between 
  the floppy disk version and the CD version will apply. If you are playing
  the CD version, the Lemmings will not splat if they walk off the edge of
  the platform. If you are playing the floppy disk version, they will. The CD
  version makes the other variations of this level extremely easy as well,
  but if you have the dumb old floppy disk, use the step below to beat this
  one.
+ Have every Lemming dig through the ledge. Speed the release rate up to
  about 30 for now (raising it is absolutely necessary in later variations)
  so the action doesn't move so excruciatingly slow. When every Lemming is at
  the bottom and has made it to the exit, you've won. Not one Lemming can
  slip through the cracks, or you'll have to start all over. This can be a
  real pain in the butt with this version of the game, especially later on in
  the harder difficulties.

-------------------------------
Level 14   Origins and Lemmings
80 Lemmings (75% saved)
RR 20   6 minutes
-------------------------------
+ Either bash or mine through the first column in your way.
+ When you fall into the next area, you'll see a horizontal pillar stretching
  out to the right between the two columns. You must build a bridge to that
  general area so that when you bash through, your Lemmings don't end up
  falling in the water.
+ When the bridge secures safe passage to the other side, bash through the
  horizontal pillar.
+ Repeat the previous two steps once more to make it to the exit.

------------------------------------------
Level 15   Don't let your eyes deceive you
80 Lemmings (50% saved)
RR 40   8 minutes
------------------------------------------
+ Don't use any blockers until you have bashed through the three large
  columns in this level.
+ When you have completed the bashing, make the second Lemming in line a
  blocker. This will let one of them pass to forge a path for the others once
  the blocker is eliminated.
+ Build over the large pit. It should take roughly four to six bridges to do 
  this, depending on where you start building from.
+ Build over the broken stairwell so that the Lemmings don't fall in and
  catch themselves in the rope snare.
+ When that first Lemming has reached the exit, blow up the blocker and allow
  the others to follow the trail.

--------------------------------------
Level 16   Don't do anything too hasty
80 Lemmings (62% saved)
RR 1    8 minutes
--------------------------------------
+ Let one Lemming pass and make two others blockers in order to enclose the
  others in a small space.
+ It will take the builder seven or eight bridges to make it to the top.
+ Once he's made sure it's safe, the others can go to "heaven," as it were.

---------------------------------
Level 17   Easy when you know how
50 Lemmings (40% saved)
RR 99   5 minutes
---------------------------------
+ There is one sneaky little detail that this level doesn't bother to reveal:
  along the bottom row are four mashers that remain hidden from sight. That's
  what the big chunk of terrain is there for - to hide those stupid things!
  Therefore, you must find a way around them. Not to worry, here it is.
+ Put a blocker near the far left hatch so that no one goes out into masher
  territory.
+ Bash through all the column bases (except for the one on the far right) to
  get the Lemmings in one big group.
+ Exhaust your supply of floaters (yes, all 20).
+ Bash through the column base on the far right to release everybody. The
  floaters should survive and the walkers should go ker-splat. With twenty
  floaters about, you should save the minimum requirement of 40% and no more.
  There is, however, a special case (see below).

SPECIAL CASE! If you are blessed with possession of the CD version, there is
an interesting quirk in the programming that I don't understand but I love it 
anyway. If you bash through the last column with a walker, everything will 
occur as normal and your walkers will die and your floaters will live. If, 
however, you bash through the last column using a floater, the floaters AND 
walkers will survive! Ha ha! Tell me, how crazy is that? Oh! Oh! I need to 
stop and breathe.

-------------------------------
Level 18   Let's block and blow
70 Lemmings (71% saved)
RR 80   5 minutes
-------------------------------
+ Obviously, you don't want to use a bomber at a point where Lemmings will
  fall into the fire boxes, so use blockers and bomb them in safe places. Do
  this until you reach the bottom of the level and they can walk to safety.

----------------------------------------
Level 19   Take good care of my Lemmings
80 Lemmings (70% saved)
RR 20   8 minutes
----------------------------------------
+ Let one go ahead while encasing the others within the confines of two able-
  bodied blockers.
+ Start building to the exit at the middle of the last hill.
+ Once the exit is accessible, release the others.

-----------------------------------
Level 20   We are now at LEMCON ONE
50 Lemmings (60% saved)
RR 10   5 minutes
-----------------------------------
+ Build over the first pit. Losing a few doesn't matter right now.
+ When the bridge is complete, put a pass-through blocker in place. Be
  careful where you put him though. If he's on the edge of a step, Lemmings
  can pass through him on the way back as well. Plant him firmly on a step.
+ Bash through the series of seven pillars.
+ Build to the exit and increase the release rate to finish the level faster.
