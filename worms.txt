Worms is one game that doesn't really need a FAQ but I've decided to write one
anyway. (Hey, it's my first one and I need something easy.) What you'll find in
here are mostly tips to help you stomp your friends or the CPU into the ground.

This FAQ is for the original version of Worms but it could also come in handy
for its many sequels. Let's proceed shall we?

===============================================================================
3)Weapons
===============================================================================
Ah yes, probablly the most important of the game. Before I begin though I'd
like to remind you that (as far as I can see anyway) most wepons will do a
maximum damage of 50.


*******************
Airstrike:
*******************
Description:
Pick this and an airstrike from above rains bombs down on your chosen area
damaging any worms within its range

Tips:
-I don't think I have to tell you this but this can damage your own worms as
 well as enemy ones so be careful where you let it rip.
-This is pretty good on its own but for lots of carnage try aiming it at an
 area with a few mines in it.

*******************
Bazooka:
*******************
Description: 
A rocket launcher.

Tips:
-The wind alters the direction of this slightly so it helps to fire in the same
 direction as the wind is blowing or against the wind with your worm turned 
 away from the one you want to hit, this is pretty tricky though.
-With the bazooka it's extremley easy to blow yourself to kingdom come by not 
 holding down the spacebar for long enough when firing it so look out for that.
 (This is also true for the homing missile, grenade, cluster bomb and banana 
 bomb but I couldn't be bothered to put this down 5 times)

*******************
Homing Missile:
*******************
Description: 
This is like the bazooka but allows you to fire a missile at a specific point.

Tips:
-Like the bazooka the wind has an efect on this, especially over long distances
 often causing things to go horribly wrong. The tips above may help but here's
 another which I'm not really sure works or not. Here's what I do; aim at a 
 worm that has no obstacles around it or over it, aim the bazooka straight up 
 into the sky (making sure that there are no obstacles over you), and hold down
 the space bar until it shoots. It seems to be a good startegy most of the 
 time.

*******************
Uzi:
********************
Description: 
A kuel machine gun!!! 

Tips
-As the uzi bullets hit an oponent they sometines knock the worm out of range 
 of the gun resulting in hardly any damage being done so for best results use 
 it on a worm that's up against something. 
-If you fire this when you're up against something yourself you could end up 
 damaging yourself so make sure you're clear of any land close in front or 
 behind before you waste anyone.
 
*******************
Mini Gun:
*******************
Description:
This is a sweet upgraded version of the uzi that does some serious damage.

Tips
-Pretty much same tips apply for this as the uzi so have a look above. 

*******************
Dynamite:
*******************
Description: 
This is pretty self-explanitory.

Tips
-For best results place a stick of dynamite as close as you possibly can to an
 enemy, run as far away as possible (as this will do serious damage) and laugh
 as your target is reduced to within an inch of its life.
-Dynamite can also be used for making large holes in the landscape (just keep 
 well away from it first).

*******************
Mine:
*******************
Description: 
Proximity mine that detonates when you come within it's range.

Tips:
-There is only a slim chance that either a CPU or Human oponent will step on 
 one and often you don't notice these and stand on them yourself (especially 
 in the junk yard levels) so it's probably best to avoid putting them on the 
 ground.
-They're good for keeping oponents out of tunnels though and if you are feeling
 particullary evil place one on another worm's head and run.
-If there are mines around your foes you can use them to your advantage! Hit 
 the worm(s) in question using your bazooka or anything explosive and the 
 chances are that the explosion will knock them straight into the mines or 
 that the mines will be sent hurtling towards them. You could of course try 
 firing at the mines to send them flying towards the worms too.
-You can move a mine away from you slightly with the dragon punch. I'm not 
 sure if that'll be any use to you thouhgh.

*******************
Shotgun:
*******************
Description: 
A lame double barrel shotgun that gives you two shots at your enemies. 

Tips:
-This doesn't really do much damage, it's difficult to aim and like the uzi you
 could end up hurting yourself with it. 
-The only use I can think of for it is to shoot worms out of the level or into
 water or some othet liquid. For this however you need a good aim.

*******************
Grenade:
*******************
Description: 
Yep, you gussed it it's a genade with a few second's worth of a fuse. 

Tips:
-This is really hard to aim because you can't tell in what angle to fire the 
 stupid thing or how far to fire it most of the time. If you suck like me I 
 advise to only use it for firing over short distances or into holes with an 
 enemy worm inside.
-You could also use it for blowing holes in the landscape like it says in the 
 manual. But again the difficult aiming could make this tricky.

*******************
Cluster Bomb:
*******************
Description:
A improved version of the grenade that breaks up into mini grenades on impact.

Tips:
-The fact that this breaks up into clusters vastly improving your chances of 
 hitting someone and because of this is a lot better than the grenade. 
-The clusters from this scatter everywhere so be careful not to injure your own
 team.

*******************
Banana Bomb:
*******************
A monster upgrade of the cluster bomb that, on impact splits into banana shaped
explosives that will cause damage like you wouldn't believe! ^_^

Tips:
-Um, this causes A LOT of damage over a reasonable sized area so again watch 
 out for your own team and try to hit as many enemies as possible, you might 
 only get one during the entire level use it wisley.

*******************
Sheep:
*******************
Description:
A sheep that hops around the place until you blow it into pieces and doing 
serious damage to anyone nearby. Nice.

Tips
-This sheep is pretty dumb and won't make it over most holes and obstacles in 
 the landscape so try to use it on reasonably flat land. If you don't you could
 well see it hopping back in your direction! 
-A sheep will detonate after a certain period of time if you don't detonate it
 yourself.

*******************
Dragon Ball:
*******************
Description:
This is a projectile that your worm fires at your oponents Street Fighter 
style. 

Tips:
-This isn't that useful but it's better than most things for knocking oponents
 off the level or into water, lava etc because even if you mess it up and miss
 you still do some damage.
-You can move a mine away from you slightly with the dragon ball.

*******************
Fire Punch:
*******************
Description: 
Another martial arts inspired move. Your worm jumps into the air punching 
any worms in front of it in the process.

Tips:
-It's useful for the same things as the dragon ball but is also great for 
 making a short tunnel straight up from another tunnel if you need to get out
 into the open or whatever.

*******************
Teleport:
*******************
Description:
Does what it says. Teleports you to a choosen part of the map. 

Tips:
-This is useful for claiming bonus crates, just teleport directly over the 
 crate and you'll get it before anyone else.

===============================================================================
4) Equipment
===============================================================================
*******************
Girder:
*******************
Description:
A metal girder that comes in various shapes and can be placed at various 
angles.

Tips:
-These can be used as a bridge, to trap other worms (see section 5) or can be 
 used with other girders to form a stairs. 
-If the gidrer isn't being put up by pressing the space bar then you probably 
 have to leave a tiny gap between it and any nearby land.

*******************
Blowtorch:
*******************
Description:
A blowtorch that can be used as a (useless) wepon or to dig horozontal and 
diagnol tunnels.

Tips:
-When you use a blowtorch stop tunneling when you are coming near the side/
 bottom of the screen because your worm will keep going and get killed.
-You only have to press fire once to get tunneling. There's no need to hold it
 down.
-To stop tunneling before your worm stops automatically just press the space 
 bar again. 

*******************
Kamazakazee:
*******************
Description:
Pick this and your worm goes nuts and flies straight through the air for a 
certain distance sending any worms it meets flying and probably killing 
itself in the process.

Tips:
-Use it to send a large group of worms flying, maybe even off the screen or 
 into water if it's used right or if you're lucky. 
-Use it on resanobly flat land for best results or else your worm could well 
 end up tunneling underneath your chosen targets rather than hitting them or 
 something.

*******************
Bungee:
*******************
Description:
A bungee rope that lets you drop off heights without loosing your go. 

Tips:
-Once you select the bungee it lasts until you select another piece of 
 equipment or a weapon so there is no need to select it for every big fall.
-This can be used any number of times without costing you a go.

*******************
Ninja Rope:
*******************
Description:
Not really a rope but more of a grappling hook.

Tips:
-This is really a very useful piece of kit. If you find yourself far away from
 any other worm
 you can use it to pull yourself to vertical sloping pieces of landscape like 
 trees or attatch it to an overhead girder or something and swing to a certain
 area.
-If you find yourself beneath a small ledge you can swing onto it by attaching
 the rope to the edge of the ledge and by swinging back and forth until you are
 at a point slightly over it. Then quickly pull yourself in towards it and let 
 go. With any luck your worm will end up on the edge of the ledge. For best 
 results keep the rope at a decent length when doing this.
-You can speed up the speed you are swing at by quickly pressing the left and 
 right keys.
-Like the bungee using this any number of times doesn't cost you a go.

*******************
Drill:
*******************
Description:
A pneumatic drill that drills a hole straight into the ground. 

Tips:
-This is useful for defensive play (see section 5). 
-Again like the blow torch if you are nearing the bottom of the screen stop as
 your worm will keep tunneling and kill itself.

*******************
Skip Go:
*******************
This isn't equipment but it's in the same menu as it. If you press this you 
skip your go. Now why would you wan't to do that?

*******************
Surrender:
*******************
Use this and your worms will surrender to the enemies. Wimp.

===============================================================================
5) Defensive Play
===============================================================================
What do you do in Worms when the odds are piled against you and you will be 
easily killed if you try to attack? Surrender? Nope, you defend yourself from 
your enemies and plan your attacks carefully and win (Well, you don't have to 
I'm just saying). Here I'll give you some (hopefully) helpful techniques. 

-Take cover! Dig yourself a tunnel and get away from your oponents. If you are
 playing against other people leave a mine at the entrance if not don't bother,
 the computer oponents are too dim to think of coming after you.

-You can dig straight ahead, or diagonally up or down with the blowtorch, 
 straight down with the drill and straight up with the dragon punch.

-Look out for mines. Even when you're beneeth them they can still damage you 
 and blow a hole in your tunnel if you get too close.
 
-As I said before computer oponents are idiots. Position yourself in a tunnel 
 directly unerneath one of them and there's a good chance that he will hit 
 himself or a another oponent will hit him trying to get you.

-Prividing that there isn't too much ground between you and your opponent you 
 can cause some serious damage by placing dynamite in a tunnel beneath him and
 running away fast. Mind you this will probablly create an easy access 
 entrance to your tunnel for everyone.

-In a similiular train of thought to the last one if you position yourself 
 directly underneath a worm, providing that there isn't too much space between
 you you can do a dragon punch and damage him. It's  best to do this only whem
 he has a small ammount of life left as you will probably end up with him 
 falling back down into the tunnel with your victim if not.

-Girder baby yeah! You can use girders to box your oponents in so that they 
 can't move in any direction. This is especially good against ones stuck in 
 holes when one girder at the mouth of the hole will do the job. Try to use as
 little girters as possible and make sure that there's no way for others to 
 get out of your girder trap. Humans will of course probablly tunnel out but 
 computer oponents will just sit there skipping their gos (or teleporting). 
 Providing that they don't/can't teleport you can now do some damage to them. 
 The best way to do this is to go on top of ther girder them they are trapped 
 under or to tunnel underneath and place some dynamite on it. You can also try
 other things like fire punch, sheep and banana bomb. Be creative! You should 
 make sure however that the girder is as close as possible to the 
 worm to ensure max damage.

-You could also make tunnels so that when the right time comes along you can 
 move out of it with the monkey rope or otherwise and attack an opponent. Make
 sure that the opponent is nearly dead though as otherwise you will be stuck 
 outside the tunnel when you have shot at your target. Unless you only take one
 shot with the shotgun and then retreat, firing the gun in your tunnel in a 
 place where you won't damage yourself.

===============================================================================
6) Other Tips
===============================================================================
Well here's the stuff that didn't go anywhere else.

-When a worm dies it blows itself up. This damages nearby worms near it so 
 watch out for this when playing, especially in sudden death mode.
-Happly, ammo crates explode very nicley when shot at. You can shoot them and 
 they will damage any nearby worms or target worms next to these crates with 
 an explosive weapon like the bazooka or grenade for even better results.

===============================================================================
7) Game Settings
===============================================================================
Here I'll look at some of the options in the game and I'll offer some 
(unhelpful) suggestions on which way to configure the game. 

Move Time:
This changes the ammount allowed for each player to make his/her move. The 
shorter the time the harder the game gets. If you want to be very strategic 
set this pretty high or turn it off. On the other hand if you have some 
friends over who are rubbish, taking ages to do anything to annoy you etc. 
you know what to do.

Round Time:
Changes the ammount of time allowed for a round before sudden death mode is 
activated. If you don't want want a quick game turn it off so that you can 
battle it out utill the end.

Mactches To Win:
Can be set to 1 or 2. This really depends on how long you want the match to be
and how skilled the players are. 

Worm Placing:
This can be set to random or teams. With team placing you are more likley to be
hit with an airstrike because they are gouped together when you begin the 
level. Random placing is better but your team can still be put in out of reach
places or trapped where the other team can easily get them and can even stuck 
in a certain place that can only be escaped by teleporting.

Automatic Action Replay:
This replays any move in the game that resulted in 2 kills or more and the 
final blow in the round. IMO it's just annoying. Turn it off.

Sudden Death Mode:
This reduces all worms energy to 1 when the round time is up. I find that the 
game tends to be better when this is turned off.

Land Mines:
With this you can change the ammount of land mines that are present in each 
course. They are often annoying but playing without them isn't as much fun. 

Banzi Mode:
Makes all explosions in the game the strength of dynamite. I've used this a few
times but I didn't really notice any difference in the game. 

Clear League Statitistcs:
Erm...it clears all league statistics. Not that they're much use anyhow.

Weapons:
Here you can decide to turn certain weapons on, off or give them a limited use.
This is great for limiting that stupid weapon you mate is lethal with and 
insists on using all the time (muhahahaha).

Sample Set:
This lets you pick the language/accent the worms use.

Team Entry:
If you want to pulverise the Tellytubbies here's your chance. Just pick an 
existing team and you can change the name of the team and the individual worms
names.

===============================================================================
8) Levels
===============================================================================
Here's the lowdown on each type of level in the game (Tsk, more filler). 

Oh, remember that you can generate your own levels instead of having them 
generated by the computer. Just press the space bar when the level's being 
generated and type any combonation of letters and numbers. Type the same ones 
in again and you will access the same level again.

pikes.

Note:
There's probablly more obstacles in this level than in any other one in the

thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view.

*******************
