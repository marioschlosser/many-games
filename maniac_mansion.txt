Introduction

Hello again, TSC here with his ninth FAQ. I decided to write this guide 
just after playing the game through for the first time, partially 
because it's a fun and challenging game, and partially because I didn't 
have anything else to write about. Hopefully, some of you have read my 
previous guides, all of which can be found on GameFAQs.com, and all of 
which are shamefully advertised here:

+ CTR: Crash Team Racing (PSX)
+ Dr. Brain: IQ Adventure (PC)
+ Wario Land II (Game Boy Color)
+ Wario Land 4 (Game Boy Advance)
+ Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (PC)
+ The Curse of Monkey Island (PC)
+ Rayman 3: HoodLum Havoc (PS2)
+ Rayman 2: Revolution (PS2)

Feel free to send me e-mail if you find any errors or if you notice any 
secrets. Just label it clearly so I don't mistake it for spam, and 
check the ENTIRE walkthrough, AND the FAQ section, before sending me a 
question. If you send me threats, spam, insults, spam, insincere 
messages, spam, incomprehensible gibberish (i.e. "yo man yur gid is 
kewl but yu missd something) spam, spam, or spam, I will block you. But 
other than that, feel free to write! You can reach me at 
ts_chapman@yahoo.com (I am not responsible for long reply delays).

Also, if you need help in the game, but don't want to be just given the 
answers by a full walkthrough, you might want to check out the Items 
section after the main guide, or (for even less revealing hints) the 
Guide to he Mansion before the main guide.

The Story
*********

It has been twenty years since a mysterious purple meteor came hurtling 
out of the sky and made a large crater in the front lawn of a large 
Victorian mansion belonging to the Edison family. Dr. Fred, his wife 
Nurse Edna, and their son Weird Ed were reclusive people who left the 
house very rarely, but the meteor's arrival brought about a strange 
change in Dr. Fred. Now, a local cheerleader has vanished without a 
trace. Dave, her boyfriend, has gathered a few of his close comrades on 
a mission to invade the mansion and save Sandy. 

********
Controls
********

At the bottom of the screen at all times during the game, except 
cutscenes, there are twelve "verbs" – Push, Pull, Give, Open, Close, Go 
To, Get, Use, Read, New Kid, Turn On, and Turn Off. Click on one of 
these verbs to start a sentence, and then click an object on screen or 
in the inventory to finish it. For example, if you clicked "Get" then 
clicked on a key, the sentence would read, "Get key" and your character 
would then pick it up if possible. Sentences with the verbs "Use" and 
"Give" will have more than two parts. For example if you clicked "Use", 
then the same key in your inventory, then a door, the sentence would 
read "Use key in door" and your character would unlock the door. "Use" 
is for combining two items, while "Give" enables you to switch items 
between the inventories of your characters. "New kid" also requires 
some explanation. If you choose "New Kid" a list of your three party 
members appears. Choose the one you are currently playing as to exit 
the menu, or choose another name to switch to that character with their 
separate position, abilities, and inventory. If the kid you choose is 
dead (see "Hazards in the Mansion" below) you will see only their 
gravestone.

**********
Characters
**********

-------------------------------
The Teenagers and their Skills
-------------------------------

---Dave---

Background: Sandy's boyfriend, who is very sure he saw Dr. Fred bring 
Sandy to the old mansion. Dave has red hair and is willing to do 
whatever possible to save Sandy. 
Skills: None.
Weaknesses: See above. 
For: Dave is a mandatory character and is automatically selected. Good 
thing too, or nobody would choose him.

---Bernard---

Background: Physics champion and all-around nerd, Bernard nonetheless 
is a valuable character. His technical skills are highly sought after 
as he can repair radios and telephones. 
Skills: Can fix the telephone; can fix the radio in Dr. Fred's room.
Weaknesses: Afraid of the Green Tentacle, and refuses to even be in the 
same room with him. For some reason, not afraid of the Purple Tentacle.
For: Beginners or players who don't really want a challenge.

---Syd and Razor---

Background: Syd and Razor are both musicians who can use the piano. 
They are listed as one character because they have the exact same 
skills. Syd is the boy, Razor is the girl.
Skills: Can play the piano well.
Weaknesses: If you forget to pull the stamps off the package before 
giving it to Weird Ed, they're useless.
For: Slightly more advanced players.

---Wendy---

Background: Wendy wants to be a novelist. It's surprising that she 
isn't one yet because she has great writing skills, even to the point 
where she can rewrite a manuscript in a matter of minutes.
Skills: Can rewrite the meteor's manuscript.
Weaknesses: If you forget to pull the stamps off the package before 
giving it to Weird Ed, she's useless.
For: Players who have played through once or twice.

---Michael---

Background: Ace photographer for the college newspaper, Michael is the 
only one of Dave's friends who knows how to use a darkroom. He can 
befriend Weird Ed as well.
Skills: Can develop Weird Ed's plans to defeat the Meteor.
Weaknesses: None to speak of.
For: Players who have played through once or twice.

---Jeff---

Background: Known as "surfer dude," Jeff is somewhat ungifted in the 
area of rescue-related talent, to put it lightly.
Skills: Can fix the telephone.
Weaknesses: Redundant; Bernard also has his only skill. Also, has no 
way of getting past Purple Tentacle.
For: Advanced players.

-------------------------
Residents of the Mansion
-------------------------

---Dr. Fred---

Apparent villain of the game, Dr. Fred is actually slave to the mind 
powers of the evil meteor. Formerly a quack with medical degrees from 
correspondence courses, Fred has raised a family in his giant mansion. 
Some of his greatest creations are the Zom-B-Matic machine, which the 
meteor uses to control him, and living, disembodied tentacles.

---Nurse Edna---

The strange and obscene blue-skinned (maybe that nuclear reactor isn't 
so safe after all) wife of the equally blue-skinned Dr. Fred. Edna is 
schooled in heavy breathing, hates intruders, and has a phone extension 
in her room. Use these things to your advantage.

---Weird Ed---

Ed, the son of Dr. Fred, has been trying for some time to save his 
father from the meteor, but his plans to do so were stolen. Since then 
he has remained mostly in his room, finding solace in his hamster. Ed 
loves that hamster, so don't come between them. 

---Dead Cousin Ted---

A mummy who lives in a comfortable sarcophagus equipped with a pillow 
and a TV. Ted died some time ago, but Edna is still expecting a call 
from him because she's too lazy to walk the twenty feet to his room.

---Green Tentacle---

One of the results of Dr. Fred's odd genetic breeding experiments, 
Green Tentacle lives in a musically furnished room above the good 
doctor's. He wants to get a band started but he can't. He has some 
psychological problems and can slip very easily into jealous rage.

---Purple Tentacle---

Dr. Fred's loyal servant, Purple Tentacle is less independent than 
Green Tentacle and guards the door to his lab. He is steadfast but will 
quail before a member of the Meteor Police. 

---The Murderous Purple Slimy Meteor---

Purple Meteor's origins are lost in the mists of time and space, but he 
is a wanted criminal throughout the galaxy who twenty years ago crash-
landed in Dr. Fred's front yard. He somehow found his way into the 
mind-control seat of power in Dr. Fred's Zom-B-Matic, and has been 
manipulating Fred ever since. He orchestrated the plot to kidnap Sandy 
and suck her pretty brains out.

***********************
Hazards in the Mansion
***********************

-----------
The Dungeon
-----------

The Dungeon is a large and empty room accessed through the far left 
door in the basement. If one of your characters runs into one of the 
following three mansion residents, they will be taken to the dungeon.

NURSE EDNA – In the first few minutes after entering the house, Nurse 
Edna is located in the kitchen next to the refrigerator, but for the 
rest of the game, she is in her room (unless she is taking someone to 
the dungeon).

WEIRD ED – Weird Ed spends all his time in his room, unless the 
doorbell sounds. There is one cutscene in the game where Ed decides to 
get something to eat, so when you see this, if you are between Ed's 
room and the kitchen, get into an adjoining room QUICKLY to avoid him 
and stay there for ten seconds to a minute (depending on where you are 
with respect to his room). Do the same when you see the scene 
indicating he has left the kitchen or if the doorbell rings. If you 
have Ed's hamster, and he finds you, give it to him to score a one-time 
free pass out of the dungeon. Give him his package, though, and from 
then on he will never take either of the supporting characters to the 
dungeon. He will still take whichever kid took his hamster or broke his 
piggy bank, though, but only if that kid DIDN'T give him the package. 

PURPLE TENTACLE – Located beyond the inner lab door. Purple Tentacle 
won't actually see you unless you get pretty close, but when he does, 
he will take you to the dungeon. Purple Tentacle leaves the lab only at 
the command of Dr. Fred, and Dr. Fred only commands him to if the power 
goes off or if the pool is drained. He will not take any of your 
characters to the dungeon once you show him the Meteor Police badge, 
the contract from Mark Eteer, or after Weird Ed or Green Tentacle takes 
care of him.

The way to escape the dungeon is to use the Old Rusty Key, found in the 
living room, on the door. The key can be used on either side of the 
door. There is also a loose brick under the fourth window from the 
right. If you have two kids in the dungeon, position one by the door 
and one by the loose brick. Push the brick, then switch to the kid next 
to the door and leave. Only one of two trapped kids can escape this 
way, so choose the one with the larger and/or more useful 
inventory/skills. The other will have to wait for the Old Rusty Key or 
for another kid. 

Getting into the dungeon is vital because the doors to the lab are also 
located there.

-----------------
Individual Death
-----------------

Numerous things in the game can kill your kids. If a kid dies, they 
will become a tombstone in the front yard, which you will see every 
time you switch to that kid. A dead kid's inventory is lost forever, so 
if that kid has any vital items, you'll probably want to reload the 
game from before they died. 

THE HAMSTER – Weird Ed loves his hamster very much. If you take it from 
his room, Syd or Razor (none of the others are willing to) can put it 
in the microwave and turn it on. If you give the hamster's remains back 
to Ed, he will kill whichever character gave them to him.

THE RADIOACTIVE POOL – To get into the outer lab, you need the glowing 
key from the bottom of the pool. To get it you must drain the pool. If 
you drain the pool, send a kid down into the pool, then refill it, the 
kid down there will die.

RADIOACTIVE STEAM – If you fill the glass jar with pool water, then 
microwave the jar and open the microwave, the radioactive steam will 
kill the kid that opened the microwave.

GREEN TENTACLE – As mentioned before, Green Tentacle can very easily go 
into a jealous rage. If you show him any contract not intended for him 
(i.e. one obtained by mailing Syd's tape, Razor's tape, or Wendy's 
rewritten manuscript to Mark Eteer) he will murder the kid that showed 
him the contract. 

PURPLE METEOR – Like the pool, the Meteor is highly radioactive. If you 
enter the same room as the Meteor without wearing a radiation suit, the 
radioactivity will kill you. 

---------
Game Over
---------

In addition to killing one kid, there are ways to destroy the entire 
house that involve the nuclear reactor core in the basement. This will 
cause the death of all three kids (not to mention Dr. Fred, Sandy, 
Nurse Edna, Weird Ed, the Meteor, the Tentacles, and the hamster) and 
end the game. If this happens your only option is to reload the game. 

THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS – Turn off the circuit breakers and leave them off 
for too long, and a meltdown will occur, destroying the house.

THE RED BUTTON OF DOOM – At the bottom of the nuclear pool is a giant 
red button. Pushing this button will inexplicably destroy the house.

THE POOL – If you drain the pool and leave it drained for too long, the 
buildup of nuclear water will blow up the house.

THE SELF-DESTRUCT SYSTEM – At the end of the game, Dr. Fred activates 
the mansion's self-destruct system to stop you from rescuing Sandy. To 
stop it, you need to free him from the Meteor's mind control by turning 
off the Zom-B-Matic. If you wait too long, and the timer runs out, the 
house blows up.

********************************
FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions
********************************

Q: Can I put your guide on my website?
A: YES, already. But you HAVE to write and ask first or it's copyright 
infringement.

Q: One of my kids is dead, and they had the [insert item]! What should 
I do?
A: You've got to reload the game to get your items back.

Q: I gave Weird Ed his package, but I didn't pull the stamps off yet. 
Am I in trouble?
A: Yes, if your team is Dave/Wendy/Syd, Dave/Wendy/Razor, or 
Dave/Syd/Razor. In these teams, both supporting characters need the 
stamps. Otherwise, you can get by just fine.

Q: I gave Weird Ed his package, but I still need something in his room 
and he won't answer the doorbell. Help!
A: If you don't have Michael, don't give Ed the package at all. It 
makes things much harder. If you must give him the package, though, 
here's how to get into his room afterwards. If the hamster is already 
gone, the kid that took the package can take the card key and he won't 
care. To get the stuff in the piggy bank, though, you'll need to take a 
kid he doesn't like (i.e. one who took his hamster) and send him into 
Ed's room. Have the kid who gave Ed the package wait outside the door, 
then send him or her in when Ed is off taking the other kid to the 
dungeon. 

Q: I don't have Bernard or Jeff. How am I supposed to get by Nurse 
Edna?
A: Put one kid in Dr. Fred's room and leave the door open. Then send 
another kid into Nurse Edna's room. When she is occupied taking the 
offending kid to the dungeon, switch to the kid in Dr. Fred's room, 
send him or her into Nurse Edna's room, grab whatever you can, and GET 
OUT FAST!

Q: I can't find [item]!
A: Check the walkthrough. All items are in ALL CAPS.

Q: I can't find [room]!
A: Check the Guide to the Mansion. All the room names are the same as 
the ones I use in the guide, so use the Leads To information to find 
your way from a location you know to that room.

Q: Why aren't there guides for Jeff or Razor?
A: Jeff doesn't have the skills needed to even get past Purple 
Tentacle, so with him you need all three party members, and these 
guides are for two characters only. Razor is not included because her 
walkthrough is EXACTLY the same as Syd's, to the letter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's time for the guide!

$$$$$$$$$$$
WALKTHROUGH
$$$$$$$$$$$

Each walkthrough is written entirely for the ONE character it deals 
with. In situations where two characters are needed (diverting Nurse 
Edna or opening the basement, for example) I will use Dave for that 
second character. 

There is no walkthrough for Jeff, nor is there one for Razor. Jeff 
doesn't have the skills needed to even get past Purple Tentacle, so 
with him you need all three party members, and these guides are for two 
characters only. Razor is not included because her walkthrough is 
EXACTLY the same as Syd's, to the letter.

************
Character 1
Bernard
************

------------------------
Objective 1
Get Past Green Tentacle
------------------------

Since Bernard can't be in the same room with Green Tentacle, this 
objective will be completed by Dave. As Dave, walk left past the fence 
and climb the steps to the front porch. Pull the doormat and get the 
KEY. Use the KEY in the front door and go inside. Switch to your third 
character (this is the only time you'll need him or her) and post him 
or her next to the mailbox next to the front porch.

Switch back to Dave in the front hall. Be sure to NOT enter the kitchen 
for a little while, since Nurse Edna is in there. You don't need to 
yet, anyway. Instead, climb the stairs and enter the painting room 
through the left-hand door. Pick up the BOWL OF WAX FRUIT, then return 
to the second floor landing and open the steel security door. In the 
second floor hallway, go to the end and climb the stairs. Try to go 
past Green Tentacle, and he demands to be fed. Give him the BOWL OF WAX 
FRUIT, and he announces that now he's thirsty. Go back down to the 
front hall and wait outside the kitchen door for a couple of minutes. 
Then go in and cross to the fridge. Open it and pick up the CAN OF 
PEPSI. Alternately, you can go through the right-hand door to the 
dining room and continue through to the pantry, where you'll find the 
FRUIT DRINKS. Return to the third floor and give Green Tentacle the CAN 
OF PEPSI or the FRUIT DRINKS, and he will let you through. Go up the 
stairs behind him to the fourth floor, and enter Dr. Fred's room, the 
first door on the long wall. Climb the ladder to Green Tentacle's 
bedroom, and pick up the RECORD near the mondo stereo and the YELLOW 
KEY hanging on the wall. Go all the way back down to the front hall.

-------------------
Objective 2
Unlock the Dungeon
-------------------

Switch to Bernard and enter the mansion. At some time during this 
objective, the doorbell will ring. When it does, immediately switch to 
your third character and get the PACKAGE. As the third character, go 
back to the starting point of the game. You won't need the PACKAGE as 
Bernard, nor will you need the third character anymore. 

Switch to Dave and give Bernard the KEY, RECORD, YELLOW KEY, and CAN OF 
PEPSI. Now switch to Bernard. Go through the door at the far right end 
of the hallway, through the living room, and into the library. Turn on 
the lamp and go all the way to the end of the library. Pull the loose 
panel next to the telephone and get the CASSETTE TAPE. Return to the 
front hall and go up to the second floor landing. Enter the music room 
through the door on the right. Use the CASSETTE TAPE in the tape 
recorder, then use the RECORD with the Victrola. Turn on the tape 
recorder and the Victrola IN THAT ORDER. Wait for the vase on the piano 
to shatter, then turn off the Victrola and the tape recorder. Get the 
CASSETTE TAPE and go down to the living room. Open the cabinet under 
the old-fashioned radio and use the CASSETTE TAPE with the tape player. 
Turn the tape player on and soon the chandelier will smash. Turn off 
the tape player and get the OLD RUSTY KEY. Now, if any kid gets locked 
in the dungeon, Bernard can simply go down to the basement and unlock 
the door. He can also unlock the door from the inside if he is 
imprisoned. 

--------------------------
Objective 3
Unlock the Outer Lab Door
--------------------------

If it hasn't already happened, the doorbell will ring at some point 
during this objective. When it does, immediately switch to your third 
character and get the PACKAGE. As the third character, go back to the 
starting point of the game. You won't need the PACKAGE as Bernard, nor 
will you need the third character anymore.

As Bernard, go to the front hall and stand in front of the handleless 
door that leads to the basement. Switch to Dave and pull the right-hand 
staircase gargoyle, then switch back to Bernard and enter the basement. 
Turn on the light switch and go all the way to the left. Get the SILVER 
KEY next to the fusebox. 

Leave the basement and go all the way up to the fourth floor. Enter 
Dead Cousin Ted's room and use the Hunk-O-Matic, then return to the 
front hall and give the SILVER KEY to Dave. Go out into the front yard 
(if Ed has already been there and the door is closed, use the KEY with 
it) and pull the bushes. Pull the grating and climb into the Valve 
Room. Go right and wait by the valve. 

Switch to Dave and go through the kitchen and dining room to the 
pantry. Unlock the door with the SILVER KEY and go out to the pool. 
Stand next to the ladder.

Switch to Bernard and turn on the valve, then, once the cutscene is 
over, switch to Dave and climb down the ladder. Get the GLOWING KEY and 
the RADIO, then climb out of the pool again. Switch to Bernard and turn 
off the valve. 

Have both Bernard and Dave go to the front hall. As Dave, give Bernard 
the GLOWING KEY and RADIO. You now have the necessary key to unlock the 
outer lab door!

--------------------------
Objective 4
Unlock the Inner Lab Door
--------------------------

Open the RADIO to get the BATTERIES, then enter the kitchen and get the 
FLASHLIGHT. Use the BATTERIES with the FLASHLIGHT, but don't turn it on 
yet. Instead, go out to the pool through the pantry. Open the gate and 
go through it, then open the garage with your increased strength. Use 
the YELLOW KEY with the trunk and get the TOOLS. Also, get the FAUCET 
HANDLE from the shelf. 

Go back to the front hall and give Dave the OLD RUSTY KEY. Have Dave 
wait by the basement door, then switch to Bernard and pull the correct 
gargoyle. Switch to Dave and enter the basement. Go left and open the 
fusebox, but don't do anything else yet.

Switch to Bernard and climb the stairs. Enter the painting room and get 
the PAINT REMOVER. Ascend to the fourth floor and enter the door at the 
very end of the hallway. Use the PAINT REMOVER on the orange paint to 
reveal a door. Open it and go through. 

Turn on the attic light and go over to the exposed wires. Switch to 
Dave and turn off the circuit breakers, then switch to Bernard once the 
cutscene ends and turn on the FLASHLIGHT. Use the TOOLS with the wires 
and switch back to Dave, who has probably been accosted by Purple 
Tentacle at this point. Unlock the dungeon door with the OLD RUSTY KEY, 
go through, and turn on the circuit breakers. Have Dave and Bernard 
meet in the front hall, and have Dave give Bernard back the OLD RUSTY 
KEY. Now send Bernard upstairs to the fourth floor hallway, and put 
Dave outside by the doorbell. 

Have Bernard wait just inside the door of Dead Cousin Ted's room, then 
have Dave ring the doorbell. Switch to Bernard, wait about ten seconds, 
then go out into the hallway. Enter Weird Ed's room and get the HAMSTER 
and the PURPLE CARD KEY. Then leave and go hide in Dead Cousin Ted's 
room. Switch to Dave and ring the bell again, then switch to Bernard, 
wait ten seconds, and return to Ed's room. "Get" the piggy bank to 
break it, then get a DIME and return to Ted's room. Wait a little 
while, then bring Dave up to the fourth floor hallway and have him wait 
outside Nurse Edna's door. Switch to Bernard and enter Dead Cousin 
Ted's bathroom. Use the FAUCET HANDLE with the faucet, then turn on the 
faucet to move Ted's body and reveal Nurse Edna's number. Go all the 
way down to the library and use the TOOLS with the phone. Use the phone 
and dial Nurse Edna's number.

Switch to Dave when the cutscene ends and enter Edna's room. Get the 
SMALL KEY and climb the ladder into the storage room. Turn on the 
light, pull the painting, and switch to Bernard. 

Go through the kitchen to the pantry and get the GLASS JAR. Go out to 
the pool and use the GLASS JAR with the pool to get a jar of 
radioactive water. Go all the way up to the fourth floor hallway and 
enter Dr. Fred's room. Get the DIME and return to the hallway. Enter 
the portrait room and use the CAN OF PEPSI, then the GLASS JAR with the 
plant. Climb up to the hatch.

Use both DIMES with the coin slot in the control panel, then push the 
right button twice. Use the really powerful telescope to look into the 
storage room and find out the combination to Edna's safe. Switch to 
Dave and open the safe. Get the ENVELOPE inside. Since to win with 
Bernard you don't need the ENVELOPE, only its contents, you can just 
open it to get the QUARTER. Switch to Bernard and go down to the 
library. Call Edna again and, while she is occupied, switch to Dave, 
descend the ladder, pass Edna, and go out into the hallway and down to 
the front hall. Switch to Bernard and go to the front hall. Switch back 
to Dave and give Bernard the SMALL KEY and the QUARTER. 

If by this point you haven't seen a cutscene with Dr. Fred playing the 
Meteor Mess game in the arcade, enter and exit a room a few times until 
it rolls. Then, switch to Bernard and go up to the arcade off the 
second floor hallway. Use the QUARTER with the coin box. When the high 
scores list is displayed at the end of the arcade game, remember the 
score that goes with whichever initials start with "DF" because this is 
Dr. Fred's high score. (If you need to see it again, use the SMALL KEY 
with the coin box, get the QUARTER, close the coin box, and put the 
QUARTER back in). This high score also happens to be the pass code to 
the inner lab door. 

-------------------------
Objective 5
Get Past Purple Tentacle
-------------------------

Go down to the front hall again. Dave should still be there. Wait in 
front of the basement door, then switch to Dave and pull the gargoyle. 
Switch back to Bernard and re-enter the basement. Go all the way left 
and use the OLD RUSTY KEY in the dungeon door. Cross the dungeon and 
use the GLOWING KEY with both padlocks on the outer lab door. Next, try 
to open the inner lab door. When the keypad appears, enter Dr. Fred's 
high score and the door opens. (IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do anything 
after this point to make Dr. Fred send out Purple Tentacle – like 
turning off the circuit breakers or turning on the water valve – the 
doors will close again after Purple Tentacle returns).

Return to the front hall, leaving ALL the doors open (that includes the 
dungeon door) and enter the den. Open the old-fashioned radio and get 
the RADIO TUBE. Go all the way up to Dr. Fred's room and use the RADIO 
TUBE with the tube socket. Read the poster to learn the number for the 
meteor police, then use the radio and call them. Watch the cutscene, 
then stay where you are. Eventually, a police siren heralds the cops' 
arrival. After another scene, return to the dungeon and get the POLICE 
BADGE. Go into the lab and give the POLICE BADGE to Purple Tentacle.

-------------
Objective 6
Rescue Sandy
-------------

If for some reason you don't have the PURPLE CARD KEY yet, GET IT 
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. If Dr. Fred turns on the self-destruct and 
you don't have it, you're as good as dead. Go through the door and 
enter the Inner Lab. Ignore Dr. Fred's attempts to stop you, and 
eventually he will run over and initiate the self-destruct sequence. 
Open the locker and get the RADIATION SUIT on, then use the PURPLE CARD 
KEY in the card slot. Open the door and turn off the lever to finish 
the game.

inside. Switch to your third character (this is the only time you'll 
need him or her) and post him or her next to the mailbox next to the 
front porch.

Switch back to Wendy in the front hall. Be sure to NOT enter the 
kitchen for a little while, since Nurse Edna is in there. You don't 
need to yet, anyway. Instead, climb the stairs and enter the painting 
room through the left-hand door. Pick up the BOWL OF WAX FRUIT, then 
return to the second floor landing and open the steel security door. In 
the second floor hallway, go to the end and climb the stairs. Try to go 
past Green Tentacle, and he demands to be fed. Give him the BOWL OF WAX 
FRUIT, and he announces that now he's thirsty. Go back down to the 
front hall and wait outside the kitchen door for a couple of minutes. 
Then go in and cross to the fridge. Open it and pick up the CAN OF 
PEPSI. Alternately, you can go through the right-hand door to the 
dining room and continue through to the pantry, where you'll find the 
FRUIT DRINKS. Return to the third floor and give Green Tentacle the CAN 
OF PEPSI or the FRUIT DRINKS, and he will let you through. Go up the 
stairs behind him to the fourth floor, and enter Dr. Fred's room, the 
first door on the long wall. Climb the ladder to Green Tentacle's 
bedroom, and pick up the RECORD near the mondo stereo and the YELLOW

TAPE with the tape recorder and turn it on, then use the piano. Turn 
off the tape recorder and get the CASSETTE TAPE. Go back up to the 
portrait room and use the ENVELOPE with the typewriter to print Mark 
Eteer's address on it. Then, go to Green Tentacle's room above Dr. 
Fred's. Use the CASSETTE TAPE with the mondo stereo and turn it on. 
Green Tentacle will drop a DEMO TAPE, so get it. Use the DEMO TAPE, 
then the STAMPS, with the envelope. Go down to the front yard, put the 
ENVELOPE in the mailbox, close the mailbox, and use the flag.

Go back inside the house and wait. Eventually, the doorbell will ring. 
Go outside and get the CONTRACT from the mailbox. Return to Green 
Tentacle's room and show him the CONTRACT. Then go to the front hall 
and switch to Dave. Have him pull the gargoyle, then switch to Syd and 
enter the basement. Go all the way left and use the OLD RUSTY KEY in 
the dungeon door. Cross the dungeon and use the GLOWING KEY with both 
padlocks on the outer lab door. Next, try to open the inner lab door. 
When the keypad appears, enter Dr. Fred's high score and the door 
opens. Go through and Green Tentacle will arrive to dispatch Purple 
Tentacle.

Objective 6
Rescue Sandy
-------------

If for some reason you don't have the PURPLE CARD KEY yet, GET IT 
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. If Dr. Fred turns on the self-destruct and 
you don't have it, you're as good as dead. Go through the door and 
enter the Inner Lab. Ignore Dr. Fred's attempts to stop you, and 
eventually he will run over and initiate the self-destruct sequence. 
Open the locker and get the RADIATION SUIT on, then use the PURPLE CARD 
KEY in the card slot. Open the door and turn off the lever, then get 
the METEOR and go through the right-hand door. Open the trunk, put the 
METEOR in, close the trunk, and use the YELLOW KEY with Weird Edsel to 
finish the game.

Character 4
Michael
************

------------------------
Objective 1
Get Past Green Tentacle
------------------------

Walk left past the fence and climb the steps to the front porch. Pull 
the doormat and get the KEY. Use the KEY in the front door and go 
inside. Switch to your third character (this is the only time you'll 
need him or her) and post him or her next to the mailbox next to the 
front porch.

Switch back to Michael in the front hall. Be sure to NOT enter the 
kitchen for a little while, since Nurse Edna is in there. You don't 
need to yet, anyway. Instead, climb the stairs and enter the painting 
room through the left-hand door. Pick up the BOWL OF WAX FRUIT, then 
return to the second floor landing and open the steel security door. In 
the second floor hallway, go to the end and climb the stairs. Try to go 
past Green Tentacle, and he demands to be fed. Give him the BOWL OF WAX 
FRUIT, and he announces that now he's thirsty. Go back down to the 
front hall and wait outside the kitchen door for a couple of minutes. 
Then go in and cross to the fridge. Open it and pick up the CAN OF 
PEPSI. Alternately, you can go through the right-hand door to the 
dining room and continue through to the pantry, where you'll find the 
FRUIT DRINKS. Return to the third floor and give Green Tentacle the CAN 
OF PEPSI or the FRUIT DRINKS, and he will let you through. Go up the 
stairs behind him to the fourth floor, and enter Dr. Fred's room, the 
first door on the long wall. Climb the ladder to Green Tentacle's 
bedroom, and pick up the RECORD near the mondo stereo and the YELLOW 
KEY hanging on the wall. 

-------------------
Objective 2
Unlock the Dungeon
-------------------

At some time during this objective, the doorbell will ring. When it 
does, immediately switch to your third character and get the PACKAGE 
and STAMPS. As the third character, wait until Weird Ed has returned to 
his room, then enter the front hall. Switch to Michael and bring him to 
the front hall as well. Switch to the third character and give Michael 
the PACKAGE and STAMPS, then return to the starting point of the game. 
You won't need your third character anymore. Switch back to Michael and 
return to whatever he was doing.

Go through the door at the far right end of the front hallway, through 
the living room, and into the library. Turn on the lamp and go all the 
way to the end of the library. Pull the loose panel next to the 
telephone and get the CASSETTE TAPE. Return to the front hall and go up 
to the second floor landing. Enter the music room through the door on 
the right. Use the CASSETTE TAPE in the tape recorder, then use the 
RECORD with the Victrola. Turn on the tape recorder and the Victrola IN 
THAT ORDER. Wait for the vase on the piano to shatter, then turn off 
the Victrola and the tape recorder. Get the CASSETTE TAPE and go down 
to the living room. Open the cabinet under the old-fashioned radio and 
use the CASSETTE TAPE with the tape player. Turn the tape player on and 
soon the chandelier will smash. Turn off the tape player, get the 
CASSETTE TAPE back out, and get the OLD RUSTY KEY. Now, if any kid gets 
locked in the dungeon, Michael can simply go down to the basement and 
unlock the door. He can also unlock the door from the inside if he is 
imprisoned. 

--------------------------
Objective 3
Unlock the Outer Lab Door
--------------------------

If it hasn't already happened, the doorbell will ring at some point 
during this objective. When it does, immediately switch to your third 
character and get the PACKAGE and STAMPS. As the third character, wait 
until Weird Ed has returned to his room, then enter the front hall. 
Switch to Michael and bring him to the front hall as well. Switch to 
the third character and give Michael the PACKAGE and STAMPS, then 
return to the starting point of the game. You won't need your third 
character anymore. Switch back to Michael and return to whatever he was 
doing.

As Michael, go to the front hall and stand in front of the handleless 
door that leads to the basement. Switch to Dave and pull the right-hand 
staircase gargoyle, then switch back to Michael and enter the basement. 
Turn on the light switch and go all the way to the left. Get the SILVER 
KEY next to the fusebox. 

Leave the basement and go all the way up to the fourth floor. Enter 
Dead Cousin Ted's room and use the Hunk-O-Matic, then return to the 
front hall and give the SILVER KEY to Dave. Go out into the front yard 
(if Ed has already been there and the door is closed, use the KEY with 
it) and pull the bushes. Pull the grating and climb into the Valve 
Room. Go right and wait by the valve. 

Switch to Dave and go through the kitchen and dining room to the 
pantry. Unlock the door with the SILVER KEY and go out to the pool. 
Stand next to the ladder.

Switch to Michael and turn on the valve, then, once the cutscene is 
over, switch to Dave and climb down the ladder. Get the GLOWING KEY and 
the RADIO, then climb out of the pool again. Switch to Michael and turn 
off the valve. 

Have both Michael and Dave go to the front hall. As Dave, give Michael 
the GLOWING KEY and RADIO. You now have the necessary key to unlock the 
outer lab door!

--------------------------
Objective 4
Unlock the Inner Lab Door
--------------------------

Open the RADIO to get the BATTERIES, then enter the kitchen and get the 
FLASHLIGHT. Use the BATTERIES with the FLASHLIGHT, but don't turn it on 
yet. Instead, go out to the pool through the pantry. Open the gate and 
go through it, then open the garage with your increased strength. Use 
the YELLOW KEY with the trunk and get the TOOLS. 

Go back to the front hall and give Dave the OLD RUSTY KEY. Have Dave 
wait by the basement door, then switch to Michael and pull the correct 
gargoyle. Switch to Dave and enter the basement. Go left and open the 
fusebox, but don't do anything else yet.

Switch to Michael and climb the stairs. Enter the painting room and get 
the PAINT REMOVER. Ascend to the fourth floor and enter the door at the 
very end of the hallway. Use the PAINT REMOVER on the orange paint to 
reveal a door. Open it and go through. 

Turn on the attic light and go over to the exposed wires. Switch to 
Dave and turn off the circuit breakers, then switch to Michael once the 
cutscene ends and turn on the FLASHLIGHT. Use the TOOLS with the wires 
and switch back to Dave, who has probably been accosted by Purple 
Tentacle at this point. Unlock the dungeon door with the OLD RUSTY KEY, 
go through, and turn on the circuit breakers. Have Dave and Michael 
meet in the front hall, and have Dave give Michael back the OLD RUSTY 
KEY.Now send Michael upstairs to the fourth floor hallway, and put Dave 
outside by the doorbell. 

Have Michael wait just inside the door of Dead Cousin Ted's room, then 
have Dave ring the doorbell. Switch to Michael, wait about ten seconds, 
then go out into the hallway. Enter Weird Ed's room and get the HAMSTER 
and the PURPLE CARD KEY. Then leave and go hide in Dead Cousin Ted's 
room. Switch to Dave and ring the bell again, then switch to Michael, 
wait ten seconds, and return to Ed's room. "Get" the piggy bank to 
break it, then get a DIME and return to Ted's room. Wait a little 
while, then bring Dave up to the fourth floor hallway and put him in 
Dead Cousin Ted's room. Switch to Michael, go back out to the hallway 
and enter Nurse Edna's room. When Edna is off taking Michael to the 
dungeon, quickly switch to Dave and enter Edna's room. Get the SMALL 
KEY and climb the ladder into the storage room. Turn on the light, pull 
the painting, and switch to Michael.

Let yourself out of the dungeon with the OLD RUSTY KEY and return to 
the front hall again. Go through the kitchen to the pantry and get the 
GLASS JAR. Go out to the pool and use the GLASS JAR with the pool to 
get a jar of radioactive water. Go all the way up to the fourth floor 
hallway and enter Dr. Fred's room. Get the DIME and return to the 
hallway. Enter the portrait room and use the CAN OF PEPSI, then the 
GLASS JAR with the plant. Climb up to the hatch.

Use both DIMES with the coin slot in the control panel, then push the 
right button twice. Use the really powerful telescope to look into the 
storage room and find out the combination to Edna's safe. Switch to 
Dave and open the safe. Get the ENVELOPE inside. Since to win with 
Michael you don't need the ENVELOPE, only its contents, you can just 
open it to get the QUARTER. Switch to Michael and enter Edna's room. 
While Edna is gone, switch to Dave, descend the ladder, go out into the 
hallway, and hide in Ted's room. After a little while, go down to the 
front hall. Switch to Michael, let yourself out of the dungeon, and go 
to the front hall. Switch back to Dave and give Michael the SMALL KEY 
and the ENVELOPE. 

If by this point you haven't seen a cutscene with Dr. Fred playing the 
Meteor Mess game in the arcade, enter and exit a room a few times until 
it rolls. Then, switch to Michael and go up to the arcade off the 
second floor hallway. Use the QUARTER with the coin box. When the high 
scores list is displayed at the end of the arcade game, remember the 
score that goes with whichever initials start with "DF" because this is 
Dr. Fred's high score. (If you need to see it again, use the SMALL KEY 
with the coin box, get the QUARTER, close the coin box, and put the 
QUARTER back in). This high score also happens to be the pass code to 
the inner lab door. 

-------------------------
Objective 5
Get Past Purple Tentacle
-------------------------

Go up to Weird Ed's room and give Ed the PACKAGE. Out of gratitude, he 
won't take you to the dungeon anymore. He will also tell you that he 
had plans to defeat the Meteor, but he lost them. He says to come see 
him when you have the plans. Go out to the front yard and get the ROLL 
OF FILM next to the bushes that are to the right of the front steps. 
Re-enter the mansion and go through the kitchen and dining room. In the 
pantry, get the BOTTLE OF DEVELOPER. Michael will automatically break 
the bottle, though, and the developer will flow through a grating in 
the floor. Go up to Dead Cousin Ted's room and enter his bathroom. Get 
the SPONGE from the sink then go out to the front yard. Go through the 
grating and use the SPONGE in the puddle of developer. Go back to the 
house and climb to the third floor, where Green Tentacle was at the 
very beginning of the game. Enter the darkroom and turn on the red 
light. Use the SPONGE with the developer tray, then use the ROLL OF 
FILM with the developer tray. Once the plans are developed, take them 
to Weird Ed.

Go to the front hall and switch to Dave. Have him pull the gargoyle, 
then switch to Michael and enter the basement. Go all the way left and 
use the OLD RUSTY KEY in the dungeon door. Cross the dungeon and use 
the GLOWING KEY with both padlocks on the outer lab door. Next, try to 
open the inner lab door. When the keypad appears, enter Dr. Fred's high 
score and the door opens. Go through and Weird Ed will arrive to 
dispatch Purple Tentacle.

Objective 6
Rescue Sandy
-------------

If for some reason you don't have the PURPLE CARD KEY yet, GET IT 
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. If Dr. Fred turns on the self-destruct and 
you don't have it, you're as good as dead. Go through the door and 
enter the Inner Lab. Ignore Dr. Fred's attempts to stop you, and 
eventually he will run over and initiate the self-destruct sequence. 
Open the locker and get the RADIATION SUIT on, then use the PURPLE CARD 
KEY in the card slot. Open the door and turn off the lever, then get 
the METEOR and go through the right-hand door. Open the trunk, put the 
METEOR in, close the trunk, and use the YELLOW KEY with Weird Edsel to 
finish the game.
